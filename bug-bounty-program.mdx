## Introduction

At **Octomind**, security is at the core of everything we do. Our SaaS platform provides business critical test generation and execution,
and we are committed to providing a secure environment for our users. We recognize that no technology is perfect, and we invite the global
community to help us identify potential vulnerabilities through our **Bug Bounty Program**.

If you believe you’ve found a security issue in our system, we encourage you to report it to us. By responsibly disclosing security
vulnerabilities, you are helping us protect our users and improve our services.

## Program Scope

### In Scope:

- All services under the domain **octomind.dev**
- SaaS platform, APIs, and related integrations

### Out of Scope:

- Third-party services or platforms (unless explicitly mentioned)
- Social engineering (e.g., phishing attacks)
- Physical security
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or anything that affects service availability
- Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries without demonstrable exploitability on **octomind.dev** services

## Rewards

Our reward program is based on the severity and impact of the vulnerability. Rewards will be determined by our internal assessment team, taking into account:

- Vulnerability criticality
- Potential impact on our users and infrastructure
- Quality of the report and clarity of the reproduction steps

| Severity | Example Impact                              | Minimum Reward |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Low      | Minor security misconfigurations            | $50            |
| Medium   | Sensitive information exposure              | $100           |
| High     | Unauthorized access to accounts or data     | $500           |
| Critical | Remote Code Execution, privilege escalation | $1,000+        |

**Note:** Rewards are at the sole discretion of Octomind’s security team, and we reserve the right to adjust based on the severity, impact, and report quality.
