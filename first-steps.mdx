## 1. Give us a URL

To be able to create test cases, we'll ask for a URL. The URL needs to be publicly accessible.

<Frame caption="First page of the setup flow: Link to your webiste, screenshot 08/2023">
  <img src="/images/setup/setup-1-url.png" alt="enter your url" />
</Frame>

## 2. Name your project

The second page will also show a screenshot of the url you provided. This is to make sure, that your URL is accessible. If it is not, you will see an Octo in a jar.
Now you'd need to give your project a name. We will propose one which is close to the url you provided.
You can change it directly.

<Frame caption="Second page of the setup flow: Name your project, screenshot 08/2023">
  <img
    src="/images/setup/setup-2-project.png"
    alt="name your project, screenshot 08/2023"
  />
</Frame>

<div class="mt-8" />

<Frame caption="Second page of the setup flow: Octo in a jar error page, screenshot 08/2023">
  <img
    src="/images/setup/setup-2-octo-in-a-jar.png"
    alt="something went wrong, url not accessible, screenshot 08/2023"
  />
</Frame>

## 3. Give us a test user

Almost all web apps are featuring a sign-in and interesting test cases can only be executed after sign-in. This is why
we are in need of a test user. Also the first test case we try to discover will be sign-in with username and password.
Credentials need to fit to the URL you provided above.

<Frame caption="Third page of the setup flow: test user credentials, screenshot 08/2023">
  <img
    src="/images/setup/setup-3-credentials.png"
    alt="enter a test user, screenshot 08/2023"
  />
</Frame>

## 3. Create an account

Now we need to sign you up. To do so, please provide an eMail address we can reach you with.

<Frame caption="Fourth page of the setup flow: create account, screenshot 08/2023">
  <img
    src="/images/setup/setup-4-create-account.png"
    alt="create account, screenshot 08/2023"
  />
</Frame>

Now, that all the configuration is done and we signed you up we'll need test cases.

<Info>
  We are triggering a test case discovery for the sign-in flow right away. If it
  is successful, you will get your first test case within minutes. If the
  discovery fails, we will investigate. This might take a little longer.
</Info>

**For now, we will create additional test cases for you manually.** We will ask you for the most common cases and we'll create 3 to 8 of them.

<Info>We will notify you once we are done with the test case creation.</Info>

## 4. Integrate Octomind into your CI/CD pipeline

If you are on [GitHub](/quickstart-GitHub) or on [Azure DevOps](/quickstart-Azure) you can use our pre-packaged integrations from GitHub to
add Octomind to your CI/CD pipeline. You'll find all information in the respective quickstart sections of this documentation.

If you are on a different CI/CD pipeline, you'll have to use our API to trigger test cases. It should be possible to add custom scripts into
your pipeline. However, you won't be able to recieve test results directly in your pipeline. You'll have to review test runs directly in our app.

### Open sourced integrations

Octomind integrations are all open source. We'd encourage you to contribute to the existing or compose new integration for other CI/CD providers.
We'll happily take over and maintain them further.

## 5. Get test results

You will receive test results directly in your CI/CD pipeline comments. Each test case will be listed with a deep link to test result details.
Please, have a look at the [Test results](/test-results) section of this documentation for more info.
