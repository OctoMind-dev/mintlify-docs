## 1. Give us a URL

We'll ask for a URL to create test cases. The URL has to be publicly accessible. We can test both in staging and in production, as long as we can access the site.

  <img src="/images/setup/setup-1-url.png" alt="enter your url screen" />
</Frame>

## 2. Name your project

The second page will render a screenshot of the url you provided. We check if it is accessible. You can name your project now. We'll propose one similar to the url you provided.
But you can choose your own.

    alt="name your project screen, screenshot 07/2024"
  />
</Frame>

<div class="mt-8" />

## 3. Sign up

Now we need to sign you up. Please, give us your email, so we can get in touch.

    alt="create account, screenshot 08/2023"
  />
</Frame>

## 4. Open the Octomind app for the first time

When you sign in to Octomind app again, you will land on your **project overview** page.

Our AI agent might be still going through your website, adding a **reachability test** and checking if there is a **cookie banner** and a **required login functionality** that need to be tested.

If the AI agent finds a required login, it will ask you for test credentials. It will use them to generate and run a **login test**. It will be added as dependency for other tests. So will be the **cookie banner test** if one is found.

<Warning>
These credentials are only usable for username/password logins not for social logins. Login using your Google, Facebook, etc. account will not work.

</Warning>

## 5. Discover more test cases

Here comes the really cool part. You can let the AI agent browse through your site to discover and generate more tests. Click on `discover`.

<Frame caption="Clicking this button will let our AI agent discover test cases, screenshot 07/2024">
  <img
    src="/images/setup/setup-6-discover.png"
    alt="AI discovery button, screenshot 07/2024"
  />
</Frame>

When it's done, the AI agent will let you know. You will find your tests on the `test cases` page.

<Frame caption="AI agent discovered test cases and you will find them in the test cases view, screenshot 07/2024">

    alt="AI discovery has finished, screenshot 07/2024"
  />
</Frame>

## 6. View your first AI auto-generated test cases

You should have your **first active test cases** generated. The AI agent has discovered the test cases, it auto-generated the test steps and has run them to validate whether they work.

They are `on` which means they will run once you trigger a **test report**.

<Frame caption="First active test cases discovered and auto-generated - screenshot 07/2024">
  <img
    src="/images/setup/setup-8-first-tests.png"
    alt="First active test cases AI discovered and AI auto-generated - screenshot 07/2024 "
  />
</Frame>

If the agent stumbled over a test step, you might have to lend a hand to review and edit a test step.

    src="/images/setup/setup-8-review-steps.png"
    alt="Test cases that need review, AI discovered and AI auto-generated - screenshot 07/2024 "
  />
</Frame>

## 7. Test your website for the first time

Once you have active test cases - they are **on**, you can **run** them. Create your first test report. Click on `run all` button and then `run in the app` and see if they found a bug.

<Frame caption="Run your first test report - screenshot 07/2024">

## 8. See your first test results

You have created your first test report, congratulations! If your test is red we will pinpoint you to step in the app that is broken. Find out more about [test reports](/test-reports.mdx) and [debugging your tests](/debugtopus.mdx).
