## 1. Register your project

You'd need an account first to get started. We do not feature self-service yet. Please, use our "join the waitlist" form on our homepage. We'll reach out for details and create an account for you.
<Frame caption="Join the waitlist">
 <img src="/images/join-the-waitlist.png" alt="join the waitlist form screenshot" />
</Frame>

We'll reach out for details and create an account for you.

<Info>We will replace this process with a self-service sign-up in the coming weeks.</Info>

## 2. Give us a URL

To be able to create test cases, we'll ask for a URL. The URL needs to be publicly accessible. Most likely it will be the url of your live system.
Depending on the type of your test cases, an account to your live system might also be required.
You will receive an `API token` from us which will allow you trigger test cases on pull requests.

We'll exchange all setup information via email.

<Info> The self-service sign-up mentioned above will also cover this step going forward. API token management including.</Info>

## 3. Tell us what test cases you want

Now, that we signed you up we'll need the test cases.

**For now, we will create test cases for you.** We will ask you for the most common cases and we'll create 5 to 10 of them.

<Warning>We will notify you once we are done with the test case creation.</Warning>

<Info>Test case editor is on our roadmap and will replace this part of the process. You will be able to compose test cases on your own at your own speed. The editor will be powered by AI.</Info>

## 4. Integrate Octomind into your CI/CD pipeline

If you are on [GitHub](/quickstart-GitHub) or on [Azure DevOps](/quickstart-Azure) you can use our pre-packaged integrations from GitHub to add Octomind to your CI/CD pipeline. You'll find all information in the respective quickstart sections of this documentation.

<Info>Currently, tests are triggered from pull requests only, since we comment test results back to the PR. We'll add an option to trigger and schedule test cases from our Octomind app directly in the future.</Info>

If you are on a different CI/CD pipeline, you'll have to use our API to trigger test cases on pull requests. It should be possible to add custom scripts into your pipeline. However, you won't be able to recieve test results directly in your pipeline. You'll have to review test runs directly in our app.

### Open source
**Octomind integrations are all open source.** We'd encourage you to contribute to the existing or compose new integration for other CI/CD providers. We'll happily take over and maintain them further.


## 5. Test results

You will receive test results directly in your CI/CD pipeline comments. Each test case will be listed with a deep link to test result details. Please, have a look at the [Test Results](/test-results) section of this documentation for more info.
