## 1. Give us a URL

We'll ask for a URL to generate test cases. The URL has to be publicly accessible. We can test both in staging and in production, as long as we can access the site.

  <img src="/images/setup/setup-1-url.png" alt="enter your url screen" />
</Frame>

## 2. Name your project

The second page will render a screenshot of the url you provided. We check if it is accessible. You can name your project now. We'll propose one similar to the url you provided.
But you can choose your own.

    alt="name your project screen, screenshot 07/2024"
  />
</Frame>

## 3. Sign up

Now we need to sign you up. Please, give us your email, so we can get in touch.

  />
</Frame>

You should receive a confirmation email with your that contains a link for you confirm your email and set your password.

## 4. Open the Octomind app for the first time

After being redirect back to [app.octomind.dev](https://app.octomind.dev/), you will land on your **project overview** page.

Our AI agent might be still going through your website, checking if there is a **cookie banner** and a **required login functionality** that need to be tested.

If the AI agent finds a required login, it will ask you for test credentials. It will use them to generate and run a **login test**. It will be added as dependency for other tests. So will be the **cookie banner test** if one is found.

<Warning>
These credentials are only usable for username/password logins not for social logins. Login using your Google, Facebook, etc. account will not work.

</Warning>

## 5. We are auto-generating test cases for you

Here comes the really cool part. Once we finished searching for a potential log-in and cookie banner test, we start generating 3 test cases for you automatically. You can follow the generation progress in the stack.

## 6. Check your site against the generated test suite

We will [execute your generated test cases](/execute-test-cases.mdx) by running test reports. These will ensure that they successfully pass when executed on your site.

<Frame caption="Run your tests for the first time - screenshot 07/2024">

    src="/images/setup/setup-9-run-tests.png"
    alt="Run your first test report - screenshot 07/2024"
  />
</Frame>

## 7. Evaluate your test results

Inside each test report, you can find the test results for the executed test cases:

- a green test result indicates a successful test run, meaning that your site passed the test described in the test case
- a red test result indicates a test failure, meaning we could not successfully run the test case steps. Click on it to see in which step in the app that is broken.

Find out more about [test reports](/test-reports.mdx) and [debugging your tests](/debugtopus.mdx).

  />
</Frame>

## 8. Go to test cases to generate more tests

You can grow your test suite by adding more test cases. For this you can jump straight into the test case view by using the "go to test cases" button in the test report.

You should have your **first active test cases** generated. The AI agent has discovered the test cases, it auto-generated the test steps and has run them to validate whether they work.

They are `on` which means they will run once you trigger a **test report**.

    alt="First active test cases AI discovered and AI auto-generated - screenshot 07/2024 "
  />
</Frame>

Use auto-generation to [generate more test cases](/generate-more-test-cases.mdx) based off existing ones or prompt our AI agent [to create new ones](/new-test-case.mdx).
