## 1. Give us a URL

We'll ask for a URL to create test cases. The URL has to be publicly accessible.

<Frame caption="First page of the setup flow - link to your website, screenshot 09/2023">
  <img src="/images/setup/setup-1-url.png" alt="enter your url screen" />
</Frame>

## 2. Name your project

The second page will render a screenshot of the url you provided. It tests that your URL is accessible. If it's not, you'll see an Octo in a jar.
Now you'd need to give your project a name. We'll propose one similar to the url you provided.
But you can choose your own.

<Frame caption="Second page of the setup flow: Name your project, screenshot 09/2023">
  <img
    src="/images/setup/setup-2-project.png"
    alt="name your project screen, screenshot 09/2023"
  />
</Frame>

<div class="mt-8" />

## 3. Select UI test cases to be auto-discovered

At the first set-up, you can select if we should auto-discover:

- a `log in` test for your web app
- a `change language` test
- a reachability `check for all links` on your page
- or just go with only custom test cases, where you can create test cases:
  - with our `AI agent` \(alpha feature\)
  - with a `Playwright recording` tool

<Frame caption="Third page of the setup flow - choose your first tests, screenshot 10/2023">
  <img
    src="images/setup/setup-3-custom.png"
    alt="choose your first tests screen, screenshot 10/2023"
  />
</Frame>

If you choose the `log in` test, we'll ask you for **test user credentials** \(test username and a password\).
The test credentials should fit the URL you provided above.

  <img

    alt="enter a test user for log-in tesst screen, screenshot 10/2023"
  />
</Frame>

## 4. Create an account

Now we need to sign you up. Please, provide an email, so we can get in touch.

<Frame caption="Fourth page of the setup flow - create account, screenshot 08/2023">
  <img
    src="/images/setup/setup-4-create-account.png"
    alt="create account, screenshot 08/2023"
  />
</Frame>

## 5. View your test results

Access the Octomind app with the magic link. Welcome!

<Frame caption="Fifth page of the setup flow - the app welcome screen, screenshot 10/2023">
  <img
    src="/images/setup/setup-5-welcome-modal.png"
    alt="welcome in the app modal, screenshot 10/2023"
  />
</Frame>

<div class="mt-8" />

<Info>
  We've triggered test case discovery for the tests you selected right away. You
  will get your first test cases within minutes. If the discovery of any of the
  tests fails, we will investigate. This might take a little longer.
</Info>

We will be adding more out-of-the-box automated test cases as we grow. In the meantime, you can try out our **brand-new free prompting feature** or record test cases with **Playwright recorder**.

## 6. ALPHA: Free prompt more test discoveries

We've added a new feature for creating test cases using [free prompting](/discovery). It's still in alpha. Experiment and let us know your thoughts!
Ping us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3ShnZMKRfA) or [drop us a note](mailto:contact@octomind.dev) via email.

## 7. Record missing test cases manually

You can also record any missing test cases using playwright directly from your terminal. See [recorder](/recorder) for
more information.

## 8. Integrate Octomind into your CI

You'll get the best results by running the tests in your CI pipeline

  />
</Frame>

If you are on [GitHub](/integrations/quickstart-GitHub) or on [Azure DevOps](/integrations/quickstart-Azure) you can use our pre-packaged integrations
from our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev) to add Octomind to your CI/CD pipeline. You'll find all information in the respective
quickstart sections of this documentation. Start from the [integrations overview](/integrations-overview).

If you are on a different CI/CD pipeline, you'll have to use our API to trigger test cases. It should be possible to add custom scripts into
your pipeline, see [manual execution](/manual-execution) for details. However, you won't be able to receive test results directly in your pipeline. You'll have to review test runs directly in our app.

## 9. Get test results

You will receive test results directly in your pull request comments if you used our native integrations.
Each test case will be listed with a deep link to test result details.
Please, have a look at the [Test results](/test-results) section of this documentation for more info.
