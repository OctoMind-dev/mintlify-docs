You have access to the following template variables that we will fill for you.
You can use them when manually editing a step or in the prompt when creatating new test cases.

- `$OCTO_USERNAME`: The username you configured for use with your page in the sign up flow or the settings
- `$OCTO_PASSWORD`: The password you configured for use with your page in the sign up flow or in the settings
- `$OCTO_URL`: The URL of your page
- `$OCTO_STABLE_UUID`: A random combination of letters and numbers that will be consistent through multiple references across a single run, but different if you run the agent again

Let us know if you what other variables are of high priority for you.
