You have access to the following template variables that we will fill in for you.
You can use them when manually editing a step or in the prompt when creating new test cases.

- `$OCTO_PASSWORD`: The password you configured for use with your page in the sign up flow or in the settings
- `$OCTO_URL`: The URL of your page
- `$OCTO_STABLE_UUID`: A random combination of letters and numbers that will be consistent through multiple references across a single run, but different if you run the agent again
- `$OCTO_TOTP`: 2-Factor authentication code if you require if for the login. Find out more about [2-FA enrollment](./2fa)
