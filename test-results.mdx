## Test results in your CI/CD pipeline

Once tests are executed, you will receive a comment in your GitHub / Azure DevOps pipeline which might look like the example below.

In the lower section of the test detail page you can find the interaction chain the system is executing. We'll enhance it with additional useful information soon.

## Debugging with Octomind

In the upper right corner you'll find two buttons.`debug test traces` will open the **Playwright Trace Viewer**. It's similar to a recording, but has a lot additional information that comes in handy when debugging.

`run locally` gives you a shell script snippet which you can use to run the test case against your local environment. This is good for setting breakpoints and stepping through the code. Click here for the [Debugtopus documentation](/debugtopus)
