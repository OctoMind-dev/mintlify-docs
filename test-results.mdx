## Test results in your CI/CD pipeline

Once tests are executed, you will receive a comment in your GitHub / Azure DevOps pipeline which might look like the example below.

In the lower section of the test detail page you can find the interaction chain the system is executing. We'll
enhance it with additional useful information soon.

## Review test results

The test result page from above has two buttons in the upper right corner. The left one is called `debug test traces`.
It will open the **Playwright Trace Viewer**. A trace is similar to a recording, but has a lot additional information that
come in handy when debugging. It allows you to quickly understand the test execution and provides a pretty accurate picture
of what went wrong.

The second button is called `run locally` and it provides you with the option to run the test case on your local
machine against your local dev environemnt. For details pelase see [Debug your code](/debugtopus).
