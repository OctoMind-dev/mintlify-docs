Once test cases are executed, you will receive a comment in your GitHub/Azure DevOps pipeline which might look like the example below.

Each test case will come with a link which directly navigates you to the corresponding test detail page.

In the lower section you can find the interaction chain, which the system is executing. We will enhance it with additional information soon.
In the uppert right corner you can find two buttons. 'debug test traces' will open the Playwright Trace Viewer which is similar to a recording but with a lot additional information.

'run locally' lets gives you a script code snippet which you can use to run the test case against your local environment. This is good for setting breakpoints and stepping through the code. Click here for the [Debugtopus Documentation](/debugtopus)
