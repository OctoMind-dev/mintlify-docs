The external API enables seamless integration with your CI/CD system or provides a scripted method to execute tests on the Octomind platform.

The API is a straightforward REST API that requires authentication using an
[API-KEY](https://octomind.dev/docs/get-started/execution-without-ci#create-an-api-key).

The api documentation also provides a playground to test all endpoints, you only need to get an api key for your project first.

To facilitate working with the API, a [CLI](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/cli) is also available.
