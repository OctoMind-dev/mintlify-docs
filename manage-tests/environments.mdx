Environments enable you to run your tests across multiple deployments of a website, ensuring that each instance of the
site functions as expected. With environment support, you can configure testing to match specific deployment settings
and validate changes across different stages.

Environments provide a structured way to:

- Isolate configurations for different deployments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- Customize testing settings specific to each deployment (e.g. user credentials, etc.).
- Perform targeted tests and debugging without interfering with production data or workflows.

After creating a project, Octomind provides you with the default environment, with the url you provided during setup.

## Creating a new test environment

To add another environment, go to the environments page

  />
</Frame>

In the new environment setup:

1. Name the environment – give a it a unique name to differentiate it from others.
2. Set the target URL – specify the URL which describes the "default" deployment of this environment - you can still override the URL at runtime.

To clarify the difference between an `environment` and a `project` we created this [short guide](/guides/project-environments).

## Configure variables

Customize global variable values for each environment. By default the values from the default environment will be used.

## Configure authentication

You can set up authentication for each environment. By default the values from the default environment will be used.

You can setup [basic authentication](/advanced/basic-authentication) or [2-factor-authentication](/advanced/2fa).

## Exclude test cases from specific environments

To exclude a test case from an environment, open the test case and unselect it. Excluded environments won't trigger downstream test reports.

## Additional settings

In the `enviroments settings` view, you can also:

- select a [proxy server](/proxy/proxy-settings)
- add a custom [test ID attribute](/runtime/testid-attribute)
- customize [timeout per step](/get-started/execute-tests#test-timeout)
- add [custom headers](/runtime/custom-headers)
- enable [cross origin iframes](/advanced/cross-origin-iframes).
