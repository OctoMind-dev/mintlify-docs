## Where to view your test reports

You will find a summary of the most recent 4 test runs in the `test reports` section in the project overview. Click on `show more` to see more than the last 4 test runs. The `test reports` menu in the sidebar lists all recent reports in chronological order, starting from most recent at the top.

Test reports are tied to a single target execution URL, so one specific deployment of your website or app, e.g. a branch deployment during a pull request.

## Scheduled test runs

If you want to [run your tests on a fixed schedule](/run-tests/execution-scheduled), the `test reports` section in the `project overview` gives you the option of a daily, weekly or bi-weekly interval.

This ensures that your app works flawlessly over time. We will send you an email notification if any of your tests fail.

## Test reports in your CI/CD pipeline

If you integrated Octomind into your [CI pipeline](/integrations/integrations-overview), we will comment test results back in your pull request after a completed test run.

There will be a row for each test with the following information:

| column      | description                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| description | name of the test case                                     |
| status ‚úÖ   | execution successful                                      |
| status ‚åõÔ∏è   | execution in progress                                     |
| status ‚ùå   | execution failed                                          |
| status üíî   | something went wrong on our side during execution         |
| details     | link which takes you to the test case details (see below) |

## Test report details

When you click on a specific test report in the app or on the link in your commit comment, a `test report overview` with all the results and more details will open.

If triggered manually, you will find the user who triggered it and when. When triggered via CI integration, you will find a link to the `commit` that triggered it.

## Test result details

If you click on one of the tests within the test report, you will find details about the execution and its results.

It will give showcase test step timeline to understand what the execution did exactly. You can swipe through the steps back and forth to see all the interactions Octomind executed for this test run.

The test result detail gives you insight into pre-classified root cause of a test failure, agent commentary, original prompt, you can compare test runs, check error log and more.

It gives you all the necessary info to inspect broken test a fix the app or your test, depending on what caused it. [This is how you do it.](/maintain-tests/inspect-broken-tests)

## Debugging a failed test

In the `maintain tests` section of this documentation, we explain [why tests fail](/maintain-tests/why-tests-fail), how do you [inspect the cause](/maintain-tests/inspect-broken-tests) and how you can [fix broken tests](/maintain-tests/auto-fix).
