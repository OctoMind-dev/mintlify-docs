## Installation

### 1. Global installation (recommended)

Install the Octomind CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @octomind/octomind
```

<Note>
  This is the **simplest and recommended way** to install the CLI. It makes the
  `octomind` command available globally on your system.
</Note>

### 2. Use via npx (no installation required)

You can run the CLI without installing it by using npx:

```bash
npx @octomind/octomind -h
```

This is useful for one-off commands or trying out the CLI without installing it.

<Expandable title="3. Advanced installation (for dependency conflicts)">

If you encounter dependency conflicts with the global installation, you can install the package in a custom location:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/packages
cd ~/.local/packages
npm install @octomind/octomind@latest
# either create an alias
alias octomind="node ~/.local/packages/node_modules/@octomind/octomind/dist/index.js"
# or create a symlink
sudo ln -s ~/.local/packages/node_modules/@octomind/octomind/dist/index.js /usr/local/bin/octomind
```

This will install the package to `~/.local/packages` and create symlinks in `/usr/local/bin` or creates an alias.
This is necessary to avoid dependency conflicts when installing the package globally.

If you also want to install auto completion (see below), then you should use a symlink in favor of an alias.

<Tip>
  Please make sure that there is no `package.json` in the `~/.local/packages`
  directory or above as this will change where npm will install the package.
</Tip>

## Updating

If you installed globally:

```bash
npm update -g @octomind/octomind
```

If you used the advanced installation method:

```bash
cd ~/.local/packages
npm install @octomind/octomind@latest
```

## Initializing the CLI

After installing the CLI, you need to initialize it by setting up your API key and optionally a test target ID. This configuration allows you to avoid passing these parameters for subsequent commands.

```bash
octomind init \
  [--api-key <key>] \
  [--test-target-id <id>] \
  [--force]
```

### Options

- `-k, --api-key`: Your Octomind API key (will prompt if not provided)
- `-t, --test-target-id`: Test target ID (optional)
- `-f, --force`: Force overwrite existing configuration

### Getting Your API Key

<Snippet file="snippet-apiKey.mdx" />

### Example

```bash
# Initialize with API key
octomind init --api-key your-api-key-here

# Initialize with API key and test target ID
octomind init --api-key your-api-key-here --test-target-id your-test-target-id

# Force overwrite existing configuration
octomind init --force
```

Once initialized, you can use other CLI commands without having to specify your API key or test
target ID with each command.

## Autocompletion

On macOS and linux you can enable autocompletion by running the following command (works for bash, zsh & fish):

```bash
npx @octomind/octomind install-completion
```

You can disable autocompletion by running the following command:

```bash
npx @octomind/octomind uninstall-completion
```

Autocompletion will only work if you have installed the package globally and created a config file with `npx @octomind/octomind init`.
This way even entityIds like environmentIds or testCaseIds will be autocompleted.
