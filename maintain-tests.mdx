## Why tests fail

`Red` signals the test has failed. This is due to 3 reasons:

1. **You have a bug in your app**

We will pinpoint you to exact moment where it broke. Swipe through the **report snapshots** or launch the **trace viewer** for more details. For an even more precise debugging, we created the open source [Debugtopus](/debugtopus.mdx) to use locally on your machine.

2. **The test is broken**

End-to-end tests tend to break when the app changes. This is not just annoying, but a major time investment.

If you would like to fix the test on your own, read further. But we can also fix it for you. This feature in included in [Octomind's paid tiers](https://www.octomind.dev/pricing).

3. **The test is flaky**

Flaky tests produce different results when running the exact same test case. We are deploying multiple strategies to fight flakiness, but it can't be prevented 100% of the time just yet.

## Inspect the reason of the failure

From the [test report](/account-view/test-reports.mdx), go to the **debug** tab of your test detail and launch the **trace viewer**.

The **trace viewer** will highlight the exact place in the test execution where the test failed. Learn how to inspect [Playwright trace viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer) step by step to identify the culprit of the broken test.
Our open source [Debugtopus](/debugtopus.mdx) is an additional help that allows you to set breakpoints and step through the code.

## Correct the broken test steps

This applies when your app is OK, but the test is broken. Use our editing tools to quickly add, remove steps or adjust locators. Here is how you [edit test cases](/edit-test-case.mdx).

## The Hack: How we fix our own tests

Test often break in more places and fixing them one by one can become annoying. It doesn't have to.

Since we dogfood our own end-to-end tests, we have discovered this easy hack:

1. go to the test case
2. check the **prompt** - if it's not matching the desired flow anymore, adjust it
3. click `regenerate steps`
4. select the last step you wish to keep
5. confirm `generate steps`

The **AI agent** will re-generate steps of your test and validate them. If it's alright, click `save & run`. If it needs adjustment, this is [how you edit test cases](/edit-test-case.mdx).

<Tip>
  If snapshots in preview don't display properly, or the state of the run is all
  green and you can't tell which step broke, refresh it by hitting the `run
  only` button under `save & run`.
