Octomind supports file upload when running a test.

To enable this simple insert a step in your test case and provide a URL where the data that you want to
upload is located (e.g. google drive link).

The url needs to be publicly available so that the test case runner can access the data to upload.

<Frame caption="screenshot 12/2024 file upload">
  <img src="/images/advanced/upload.png" alt="screenshot 12/2024 file upload" />
</Frame>

The locator needs to reference the file upload load element. You can use the picker to select the element
on the page.

Then select upload interaction type and paste the url for the data to upload in the input field below.

The url accessibilty will be checked an you get a green checkmark if the url is correct and the data can be accessed.
