## Logging in with Email

There are two ways to log in with email:

1. Your authentication provider sends an email with a link to log in
2. Your authentication provider sends an email with a one-time password

In both cases, you need an email inbox that you can access. For this purpose, we've added an integrated inbox with a specific email address for your test environments.

You can find your email address in the environments section of your project under the "Authentication" tab.

  />
</Frame>

This email address is also available via the `$OCTO_EMAIL` variable.

To prepare for a login test, you should add this email address to the account you want to test.

You can manually test the flow and check for emails by using the `view received emails` button in the Octomind app.

This will open a view where you can see all the emails that were sent to the email address you added.

In your test case, you can now use a specific step to handle the email flow.

  />
</Frame>

This step will wait for the email to arrive and open it on the right side like a normal web page.

You can then use additional steps in your test case to handle the email flow. Either click on the link or extract the one-time password.

To extract the one-time password, you can use the "Extract" step.

<Frame caption="Screenshot 03/2025: OctoMind extract step">
  <img
    src="/images/advanced/extract-step2.png"
    alt="Extract step, screenshot 03/2025"

The extracted value will be stored in a [dynamic variable](/advanced/variables#dynamic-variables) that you can use in your test case.
