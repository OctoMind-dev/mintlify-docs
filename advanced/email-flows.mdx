## Logging in with email

There are two ways to log in with email:

1. Your authentication provider sends an email with a link to log in
2. Your authentication provider sends an email with a one-time password

In both cases you need a email inbox that you can access. For this we added an integrated inboxwith a specific email foryour test environments

You find your email address in the environments section of your project in the tab "authentication".

  />
</Frame>

This email address is also available with the $OCTO_EMAIL variable.

To prepare for a login test you should add this email address to your account you want to test.

You can manually test the flow and look for emails by using the "view received emails" button in the octomind app.

This will open a view where you can see all the emails that were sent to the email address you added.

<Frame caption="screenshot 03/2025 octomind view received emails">

    alt="view received emails, screenshot 03/2025"
  />
</Frame>
in your test case you now can use one specific step to handle the email flow.

<Frame caption="screenshot 03/2025 octomind email step">
  <img
    src="/images/advanced/email-step.png"
    alt="email step, screenshot 03/2025"
  />
</Frame>

This step will basically wait for the email to arrive and open the email on the right like a normal web page.

You can then use more step in your test case to handle the email flow. Either just click on the link or extract the one-time password.

To extract the one-time password you can use the "extract" step.

<Frame caption="screenshot 03/2025 octomind extract step">
  <img
    src="/images/advanced/extract-step2.png"
    alt="extract step, screenshot 03/2025"
  />
</Frame>

The extracted value will be stored in a [dynamic variable](/advanced/variables#dynamic-variables) that you can use in your test case.
