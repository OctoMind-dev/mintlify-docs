## Logging in with Email

There are two ways to log in with email:

1. Your authentication provider sends an email with a link to log in
2. Your authentication provider sends an email with a one-time password

In both cases, you need an email inbox that you can access. For this purpose, we've added an integrated inbox with a specific email address for your test environments.

You can find your email address in the environments section of your project under the "Authentication" tab.

    alt="Email address, screenshot 03/2025"
  />
</Frame>

This email address is also available via the `$OCTO_EMAIL` variable.

To prepare for a login test, you should add this email address to the account you want to test.

You can manually test the flow and check for emails by using the `view received emails` button in the Octomind app.

This will open a view where you can see all the emails that were sent to the email address you added.

<Frame caption="Screenshot 03/2025: Octomind view received emails">
  <img

    alt="View received emails, screenshot 03/2025"
  />
</Frame>

In your test case, you can now use a specific step to handle the email flow.

<Frame caption="screenshot 03/2025: Octomind email step">
  <img
    src="/images/advanced/email-step.png"
    alt="Email step, screenshot 03/2025"
  />
</Frame>

This step will wait for the email to arrive and open it on the right side like a normal web page.

You can then use additional steps in your test case to handle the email flow. Either click on the link or extract the one-time password.

To extract the one-time password, you can use the "Extract" step.

<Frame caption="Screenshot 03/2025: Octomind extract step">
  <img
    src="/images/advanced/extract-step2.png"
    alt="Extract step, screenshot 03/2025"
  />
</Frame>

The extracted value will be stored in a [dynamic variable](/advanced/variables#dynamic-variables) that you can use in your test case.

## More emails

You can also use more than just one email address in your test case by combining the `$OCTO_EMAIL_PREFIX` and `$OCTO_EMAIL_DOMAIN` variables.

When you need to test with different email addresses, you can use the `$OCTO_EMAIL_PREFIX+1@$OCTO_EMAIL_DOMAIN` variable expression to generate 
different email addresses. The part after the plus can be anything that is valid in an email address and will be still delivered to the 
Octomind inbox.
