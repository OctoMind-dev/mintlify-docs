## Purpose

By default, octomind runs with all web security features enabled.
However, during AI test case creation, cross origin iframes may not be processed correctly.

## Functionality

- Enables cross origin iframes to facilitate iframe access for our agent
- Use with caution: this starts the browser with `--disable-web-security`,
  which also impacts other security features that might change the website's behavior
