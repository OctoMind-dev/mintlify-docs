The `execute javascript` interaction step allows you to execute arbitrary JavaScript or TypeScript code as part of your test flow. 
This is useful for performing custom logic, calculations, or interacting with APIs that are not directly accessible through other test steps.

## Sandbox or browser execution

There is two contexts that the code can run in:

1. **Sandbox**: The code runs in a secure, isolated environment and **cannot access
the Playwright runtime or browser context directly**. This restriction is in
place for security and stability reasons.

2. **Browser**: The code runs in the browser context and **can access
 browser context directly**. This is useful for performing custom on your application like setting cookies, etc.

### Sandbox isolation and limitations

- **No direct access to Playwright or browser context:** Your script cannot interact with page elements, cookies, or the DOM directly.
- **Resource limits:**
  - **Runtime:** Scripts are limited in execution time to prevent infinite loops and slow tests.
  - **Memory:** Scripts have a capped memory allocation.
  - **Network:** Outbound network requests may be restricted or rate-limited.

### Browser isolation and limitations

- code will be executed in the browser context and **can access
 browser context directly**. e.g. window, document, etc.

## Setting dynamic variables

You can create [dynamic variables](/advanced/variables) by printing a JSON object to `stdout` using `console.log`. These variables can be used in subsequent steps of your test.

For example, if your script creates a new document in your application and receives a document ID in the response, you can expose this ID as a dynamic variable:

```js
// Example: Creating a document and exporting its ID as a dynamic variable
async function main() {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/documents", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ title: "My Document" }),
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  // Set the dynamic variable by logging a JSON object
  console.log(JSON.stringify({ documentId: data.id }));
}

main();
```

After this script runs, you can reference the dynamic variable in later steps using `$$documentId`.

## Best practices

1. **Keep scripts short and efficient** to avoid hitting resource limits.
2. **Validate outputs** before logging dynamic variables to prevent errors in later steps.
3. **Avoid sensitive operations** since scripts run in an isolated environment with limited permissions.
4. **Use dynamic variables** to pass data between steps and make your tests more flexible.

By leveraging the `execute javascript` step, you can extend your tests with custom logic while maintaining security and reproducibility.
