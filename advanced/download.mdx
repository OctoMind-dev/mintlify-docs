Octomind supports file download when running a test.

To enable this simple insert a download step in your test case and and select the element that triggers the download.

You can then add the expected file name to the step.

<Frame caption="screenshot 08/2025 download step">
  <img
    src="/images/advanced/download-step.png"
    alt="screenshot 08/2025 download step"
  />
</Frame>

The locator needs to reference the element that triggers the download. You can use the picker to select the element
on the page.

Then select download interaction type and paste the expected file name in the input field below.

The file can also be a regex pattern although this needs a special escape sequence. To wait for and pdf file (_.pdf)
use the following pattern: `OCTOREGEX._\.pdfOCTOREGEX`
