Teardown automatically cleans up artifacts created during test execution. This cleanup can happen through UI interactions (using the app's interface) or programmatically via [javascript step](/advanced/javascript-step).

Configure teardown in the steps section of your test case panel. Select which test should run as cleanup after your main test completes.

## Viewing teardown results

After your test runs, teardown results appear with a status indicator:

- Green checkmark: Teardown succeeded
- Red cross: Teardown failed

Since all teardown steps are optional, a failing teardown does not lead to the overall test run being failed.

<Info>
  Only the steps of the teardown test itself will run during
  cleanupâ€”dependencies of the teardown test are ignored. Teardown tests should
  not have their own teardown configured.

## Teardown and dependencies

If your test has a dependency that itself has a teardown configured, we will execute it whenever the test case is ran (after). The execution order is:

### Singular dependency:

1. dependency
2. test
3. teardown of test
4. teardown of dependency

### Chained dependencies:

Dependencies execute in order, but their teardowns run in reverse:

1. dependency 1
2. dependency 2
3. test
4. teardown of test
5. teardown of dependency 2
6. teardown of dependency 1

This ensures proper cleanup order, with the most recent changes cleaned up first.
