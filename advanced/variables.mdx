Create custom variables that we will fill in for you. Reference them in the **visual locator picker** or when **prompting the AI agent** using `$` (e.g. $firstname) by adjusting the `enter text` step. For each environment you can configure custom variable values.

Do you have an existing variable list? No problem. You can upload it via a `json file`. The file has to follow this format:

```
[
  {
    "name": "my_variable",
    "values": ["a", "b", "c"]
  }
]
```

If you provide several values we will randomly choose one of them per run.

## Predefined variables:

We use also several predefined variables that do not show up in the default list, but can be used like the variables above:

- `$OCTO_USERNAME`: the username you configured for use with your page in the sign up flow or the settings
- `$OCTO_PASSWORD`: the password you configured for use with your page in the sign up flow or in the settings
- `$OCTO_URL`: the URL of your page
- `$OCTO_STABLE_UUID`: a random combination of letters and numbers that will be consistent through multiple references across a single run, but different if you run the agent again - full uuid of 36 characters
- `$OCTO_STABLE_UUID_SHORT`: a random combination of letters and numbers that will be consistent through multiple references across a single run, but different if you run the agent again - maximum length of 8 characters.
- `$OCTO_TOTP`: 2-Factor Authentication code if you require if for the login. Find out more about [2-FA enrollment](/advanced/2fa)

## Dynamic variables:

In addition to the predefined variables, we also support dynamic variables that are generated during the test execution. Dynamic variables are 
noted as $$varname and will be replaced by their current value.

Names of dynamic variables are case sensitive and must start with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, digits, or underscores.
A dynamic variable is created by an **extract step** that extracts a value from a web page using a locator and assigning it to a dynamic variable.
