If you don't have pipelines but nevertheless want to run your test reports on a regular schedule, you can do that via our scheduling feature in the test report section of the project overview page.

There, you can pick between the following run intervals:

- daily
- weekly
- bi-weekly

## Email notifications

We will inform you via email in case a scheduled test report fails. You can always opt out of these notifications in our in-app settings.
