If you don't have a CI pipeline but you would like to run your tests on a regular schedule, you can do that via our scheduling feature in the `test reports` section of the project overview page.

There, you can pick between the following run intervals:

- daily
- weekly
- bi-weekly

## Email notifications

In case a scheduled test fails, we will inform you via email. You can always opt out of these notifications in our in-app settings.
