A project is a collection of test cases and test reports tied to a website or web app. The **test target URL** you define for it is used as a basis for generating test steps. You can extend it to sub paths of your website during test case creation.

You can run your test **against a different URL** while keeping the sub paths - the URL is "templated". This allows you to [run your test cases against multiple deployments](/get-started/execute-tests#1-trigger-a-test-run) of the same application.

## Create a new project

You can always create another project if you need to **test multiple websites**. The tests won't be shared between them.

## Rename a project

Hover over the project name and an `edit` pencil icon will appear. Change the project name and check in the edit.

## Delete a project

In the upper right corner of the project main view, click on the `more` three dot icon and confirm by clicking on `delete project`.

To clarify the difference between an `environment` and a `project` we created this [short guide](/guides/project-environments).
