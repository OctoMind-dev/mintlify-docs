# Overview

Environments enable you to run your tests across multiple deployments of a website, ensuring that each instance of the
site functions as expected. With environment support, you can configure testing to match specific deployment settings
and validate changes across different stages.

Environments provide a structured way to:

- Isolate configurations for different deployments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- Customize testing settings specific to each deployment (e.g. user credentials, etc.).
- Perform targeted tests and debugging without interfering with production data or workflows.

After creating a project, Octomind Provides you with the default environment, with the url you provided during setup.
Also it shows the username and password you provided if your page requires a login.

# Creating an Additional Environment

To add another environment, go to the environments page

  />
</Frame>

In the new environment setup:

1. Name the Environment – Give a unique name to differentiate it from others.
2. Set the Target URL – Specify the URL which describes the "default" deployment of this environment - you can still override the URL at runtime.
3. Optional: Add Credentials – Provide a username and password if the URL requires login.

To clarify the difference between an `environment` and a `project` we created this [short guide](/guides/project-environments).

# Configure variables

Customize global variable values for each environment. By default the values from the default environment will be used.

# Exclude test cases from specific environments

To exclude a test case from an environment, open the test case and unselect it. Excluded environments won't trigger downstream test reports.
