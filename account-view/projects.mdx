A project is a collection of test cases and test reports tied to a website or web app. The **test target URL** you define for it is used as a basis for generating test steps. You can extend it to subpaths of your website during test case creation.

You can run your test **against a different URL** while keeping the subpaths - the URL is "templated". This allows you to [run your test cases against multiple deployments](/execute-test-cases#1-trigger-a-test-run) of the same application.

Projects are listed in the left menu bar underneath your organization. The active project is shown in the top menu to the right
of the organization.

You can always create another project if you need to **test multiple websites**. The tests won't be shared between them.
