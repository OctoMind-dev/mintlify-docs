A project is a collection of test cases and test reports tied to a website or web app. The **test target URL** you define for it is used as a basis for generating test steps. You can extend it to subpaths of your website during test case creation.

You can run your test **against a different URL** while keeping the subpaths - the URL is "templated". This allows you to [run your test cases against multiple deployments](/execute-test-cases#1-trigger-a-test-run) of the same application.

## Create a new project

You can always create another project if you need to **test multiple websites**. The tests won't be shared between them.

## Page purpose

One of our AI agents is specialized in assessing the purpose of a web page. This is a crucial piece of information that helps us identify critical user flows to be thoroughly end-to-end tested.

Rate the agent's description of your page to improve it by giving it a `thumbs up` or `thumbs down`.
