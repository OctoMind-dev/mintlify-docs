A **test case** is a set of steps that mimic a user flow. You can find an overview of all your test cases in the `test case` section of the `project overview` page or in the `test cases` page accessible from the left sidebar.

It is the place where you can add, edit or delete test cases. From here, you can also grow your test suite by [having our AI agent generate new tests](/get-started/generate-more-test-cases) based on specific test cases.

Tests are displayed in `dependency view` mode as default. It shows the test case hierarchy - how tests are chained togehter and which tests will run after which when executed.

## Folders view

We added a customizable way to organize your test cases. If you don't like the `dependency tree view` and prefer your own arrangement, you can use the folder view now.
Create new folders and add your test cases to them to organize your list as you wish.
