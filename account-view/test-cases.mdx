A **test case** is a set of steps that mimic a user flow. You can find an overview of all your test cases in the `test case` section of the `project overview` page or in the `test cases` page accessible from the left sidebar.

It is the place where you can add, edit or delete test cases. From here, you can also grow your test suite by [having our AI agent suggest new tests](/new-test-case#have-ai-agent-suggest-and-auto-generate-more-tests) based on specific test cases.
