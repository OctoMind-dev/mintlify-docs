If you don't have pipelines and want to manually trigger the test execution from outside our app, you can do it with a **cURL command**.
You can retrieve it conveniently with prefilled parameters from within the app by selecting `in app via terminal` from the `generate report` button on the overview page:

<Frame caption="generate a test report from the terminal, screenshot 02/2024">
  <img
    src="/images/rerun-in-cli-modal.png"
    alt="modal to retrieve the curl command"
  />
</Frame>

You can see how to set up your `API key` below.

The command will return a response with a link to your test report and some other information, see the [API Reference](/api-reference).

```JSON
{ "testReportUrl": "https://app.octomind.dev/testreports/<some-id>",
  "testReport":  { "id":  "<someUUID>", "status": "<WAITING|PASSED|FAILED>"}
}
```

If you follow this link, you can find the test report containing all test results of your execution.

### Blocking your pipeline

You can block your pipeline by polling the resulting test-report until the status is "PASSED" with a call to the test report API - see our [API Reference](/api-reference).

See the [API Reference](/api-reference) or a reference implementation in our [Github Action](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-action-execute/blob/main/src/executeAutomagically.ts#L107)
