## Test recommendation at sign-up

When you sign up to Octomind, our AI Agent is going on a discovery journey of your site. It takes a screenshot and tries to come up with a few suggestions for relevant tests to start with automatically.

### Cookie banner and login test

First, it's checking if there is a **cookie banner** and a **required login** that need to be tested. While this is ongoing the create test case panel will show a spinner.

</Frame>

If the AI Agent finds a cookie banner or required login on your page, you will see a _critical_ cookie banner and login test case recommendation, once pressing the "create test case" button.

    alt="AI agent recommends both a cookie and login test"
  />
</Frame>

Pressing the login test button will then prompt you for your login credentials. The agent will use them to generate and run a **login test**.
The resulting login will automatically be added as dependency for other tests when creating new ones, as will the cookie banner one if it was generated as well

We can handle [2-factor authentification (2FA)](/advanced/2fa.mdx) and [captcha](/runtime/custom-headers.mdx) in login flows as well, but you will need to help the agent out.

  />
</Frame>

<div class="mt-8" />

<Warning>
  These credentials are only usable for username/password logins not for social
  logins. Login using your Google, Facebook, etc. account will not work.
</Warning>

It's possible that the Agent fails to generate a test ([here are some reasons why](/guides/agent-fails)) or needs help with something - the test is highlighed in **yellow** on the right side, if you open it. This is a [step by step guide on how you'll help the Agent by nudging it in the right direction](/guides/help-agent-succeed).

## Refine the prompt

We will generate test cases you selected. But first, we need you to review the prompt we prepared. You can instruct the Agent in natural language to change the prompt here, or refine the prompt manually in the next step.

    alt="Refine prompt example"
  />
</Frame>

Click `generate` to add details, rename the test or refine the prompt. When everything is all set, click `finalize`.

## Spawning from existing test cases

Similar to the initial **AI test generation** during project setup you can use the `create a new test from here` to expand your test case suite. Just click the plus button
behind a test case row to get both recommended tests and the ability to [record](/build-tests/prompt-agent) or [prompt](/build-tests/prompt-agent) yourself.

You can follow the progress of the tests in the discovery view

  />
</Frame>

At the end of the agent run, the Agent should have autogenerated test steps and validated them for each test case. For those that the validation succeeds, it turns the test **ON** into active mode.

Help the Agent when it couldn't quite nail the autogeneration process - a **yellow alert** after opening highlights a failed step generation. See how you [help the Agent to generate a test case successfully](/guides/help-agent-succeed).
