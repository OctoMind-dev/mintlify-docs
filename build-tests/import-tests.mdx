## Importing tests from test management systems

You can connect Octomind to your **test management system** to keep all testing results in one place. You can also import test descriptions to seamlessly convert manual tests into automated ones.

### Import from TestRail via native integration

Our native integration with TestRail will help you import your existing test suite and play the test results back to TestRail.

<Info>Available in Pro tier and higher</Info>

Go to your organization `settings` and choose the tab `integrations`.

And connect your TestRail account.

The results from your test runs will be visible in TestRail.

### Import via MCP

You can use MCP to import tests from any test management or test orchestration system as long as it supports MCP and you're using an AI agent in your tools.

Watch this example of how we used Claude to automate manual tests from their descriptions in TestRail test management system:

## Importing test code

We don't import existing test code, yet.

The way how we structure and store test cases in Octomind is based on test steps representing interactions with the app. The corresponding Playwright test code is generated on the fly. If you are familiar with writing Playwright tests, you might notice that our test script looks different to the one you hand-code.

If you need an importer translating your tests to a format usable in Octomind, let us know. Your feedback helps us prioritize our features roadmap.
