## Creating ready-to-run tests from your agent-powered IDE

You can use your MCP suppported IDE client to have Octomind generate test directly from your codebase. The tests will be stored and hosted in the Octomind app, ready for immediate execution and built for easy maintenance.

Here is how you get started:

#### Prerequisites

- Your IDE installed (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- Node.js and npm installed
- An [Octomind API key](/api-reference)

#### Steps to Configure Octomind MCP

1. **Open your IDE**

- Launch your IDE application

2. **Navigate to settings**

- In the Settings panel, look for `User Settings` or `Settings (JSON)`
- This will open the settings.json file that contains your IDE configuration

3. **Add the Octomind MCP configuration**

- Locate the closing curly brace at the end of the file
- Before that closing brace, add a comma (if there are other settings) and then paste the Octomind MCP configuration:

```javascript
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "octomind": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@octomind/octomind-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "APIKEY": "<YOUR API KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Replace the API key**

- Replace <YOUR API KEY> with your actual Octomind API key
- Make sure to keep the quotes around your API key

5. **Save the file**
6. **Restart your IDE**

- Close and reopen your IDE to apply the changes

7. **Verify installation**

- Open a terminal in your IDE and run a simple Octomind command to verify the installation

You can tell the AI agent in your IDE to create tests from the codebase or use another data source connected to it.

Like Jira tickets for example. Check it out in this video:

## Create tests from various data sources via MCP

If you are using an **AI agent** like Claude Desktop and you have it connected to other data sources like Jira, Slack, test management tool or even your docs, you can easily create ready-to-run Octomind tests by just telling the AI agent.

Watch this example of how we used Claude to automate manual tests from their descriptions in TestRail test management system:
