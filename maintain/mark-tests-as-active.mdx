## Deciding on which parts of your test suite are executed

The more your test suite grows, the more important it gets to keep an overview over which of your tests are executed and contained in the newest test report.
In Octomind, we speak of `active` test cases, which are all the test being run when a test report is triggered.

### Activate your test case

Our agent sets newly created tests to active by default, but you can always set the active status according to your liking. \*\* Use the toggle button to switch the test between `ON` and `OFF`.
