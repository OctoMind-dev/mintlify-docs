# Hosted Octomind MCP Server
Octomind offers a cloud-hosted MCP server that provides an easy way to integrate with our platform without requiring local installation or configuration.
## Getting Started

**Endpoint**: https://mcp.app.octomind.dev/mcp

The server uses HTTPS streaming transport protocol for reliable communication. For technical implementation details, refer to the
[MCP specification for streamable HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http).

## Benefits

No local setup required - Connect directly to our hosted service
Always up-to-date - Automatically maintained with the latest features
Reliable connectivity - Enterprise-grade hosting infrastructure

This hosted option is perfect for teams who want to quickly start using Octomind's MCP capabilities without managing their own server infrastructure.

## Authentication

The hosted MCP server requires an API key for authentication. You can find your API key in the Octomind app under Settings > API keys.
<Snippet file="snippet-apiKey.mdx" />

Despite the normale Header for API key authentication is `x-api-key`, the hosted MCP server uses `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`.

## Example client

```javascript
const serverUrl = "https://mcp.app.octomind.dev/mcp";
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

console.log("Testing MCP server at:", serverUrl);
try {
    const transport = new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(new URL(serverUrl), {
      requestInit: {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
          "x-session-id": "unique-session-id",  // Optional, but recommended for sticky session routing
        },
      },
    });
    const client = new Client(
      {
        name: "test-client",
        version: "1.0.0",
      },
      {
        capabilities: {},
      },
    );
    console.log("Client created successfully!");

    await client.connect(transport);
    console.log("‚úÖ Connected successfully!");

    console.log("Server capabilities:", client.getServerCapabilities());
    console.log("Server version:", client.getServerVersion());
    const capabilities = client.getServerCapabilities();
    // Test basic capabilities
    const tools = await client.listTools();
    console.log(
      "üîß Available tools:",
      tools.tools.map((t) => t.name),
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("‚ùå Error connecting to MCP server:", error);
  }
```
To test this example, you need to have the `@modelcontextprotocol/client` package installed. You can install it using npm or yarn.
Set the `API_KEY` environment variable to your API key.

### Sticky session routing

The hosted MCP server supports sticky session routing. This means that the same session will be used for all requests. 
To support sticky session routing, you need to set the `x-session-id` header to a unique value in the `requestInit` object.

```javascript
const transport = new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(new URL(serverUrl), {
  requestInit: {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      "x-session-id": "unique-session-id",  // Optional, but recommended for sticky session routing
    },
  },
});
```
