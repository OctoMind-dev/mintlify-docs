# Overview

In the overview rail, you can observe the test case creation **date**, **name**, and the **URL** where the test case would be executed.

If the test case was run before, you can see when, alongside the outcome of that run. In that case, last run will be actionable.
Last run is populated when the `run` button was pressed.
