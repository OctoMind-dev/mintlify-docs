## Test suite setup

We will compose the test suite for you. In this way, weâ€™ll learn about the complexities and adjust our discovery technology to cover your user flows. Playwright code will be generated on the fly for execution and in a later iteration for download. Feel free to download the code and use it to your benefit.

### What we need from you to setup the test suite

## Test runs

Tests will be hosted by Octomind and executed by Octomind on pull request. For now, please, expect a delay before you receive your test results. Success will be reported immediately. Failures will be reviewed manually to learn failure reasons and to make sure we avoid false positives to the greatest extent possible.
