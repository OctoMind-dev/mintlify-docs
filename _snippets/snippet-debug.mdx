# Debug

If you wish to **debug**, simply click the `run locally` button, and within the pop-up, you will find the code that needs to be
executed in the terminal. You can copy the code by clicking on the `copy to clipboard` button.

After completing that, you will be redirected to the **Playwright test** Chromium page where is debugging all yours.
