# Debug

In the **debug** rail, you can see our steps (octo-dictionary-link) abstraction implementation in Playwright code.
You do not need to maintain or do anything with that code, it is there for transparency reasons.

There is the run locally (octo-dictionary-link) button which provides you a way to run that test case on your machine with the help of debugtopus (octo-dictionary-link).
With it, you can even run the test case against your localhost to speed up feedback loop of our tests.

By clicking `run locally` button, within the pop-up, you will find the code that needs to be executed in the terminal. (screenshot goes here) (more-screenshots)
Only parameter you need to change is <YOUR-URL> (needs update) which defines which url the test case should run against.
