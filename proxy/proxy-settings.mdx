In project settings you can control from which location your website is being discovered and also
from where your test will be runned.

Currently we support two locations:

- europe (Frankfurt)
- us (Iowa)

## Integrate a private location

You can even add your private location to access non public locations e.g. behind a firewall in a
corporate network. see [private location worker](/proxy/private-location).

As soon as your worker started, it will show up in the proxy picker.
