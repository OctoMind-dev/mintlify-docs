Whenever the octomind agent is discovering your page or the test runner is executing test cases it is sending requests to your page (or your app).

To ensure a well defined behavior all requests are send through one fixed IP address: `35.192.162.70`

## Agent discovery

Agent discovery happens as if a human would use your web application, however most of the time the agent interacts with the website slightly faster than a human would.
There might also be more than one discovery run in parallel.

## Test runner

When you "run all" testcases or a scheduled run occurs on a given test target all activated test cases are run at once and with up to 20 parallel browser sessions.
This can lead to either an overload of your application or a rate limiter getting active, if you have one in place.

## Login / Authentication

If your application requires a login the configured test user is used for the agent discovery as well as for all the test runs. This could also lead to **hitting a limit of allowed logins**, depending on your login system.
If you are using a 3rd party login service, there are most likely security configurations in place that prevent users from logging in too frequently.
in place that prevent users from logging in too frequently.

### OTP / 2FA

While octomind ist supporting a login with a one time password (OTP), one of the most likely limits that a test run will hit, is how often the same OTP code 
can be used for login.

## Rate limiter

If your application is protected against [DoS Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) with a
[rate limiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting) it is very likely that octomind test runs and/or discoverys will fail.
The easiest solutions is to configure and exception for our IP address: `35.192.162.70` (white listing).
