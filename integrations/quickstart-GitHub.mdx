## CI/CD pipeline integration

In order to integrate Octomind into your CI/CD pipeline, you will need a GitHub Action and a GitHub App.

### 1. Create an API key

<Snippet file="snippet-apiKey.mdx" />

### 2. Copy your test target Id

<Snippet file="snippet-testTarget.mdx" />

### 3. Install GitHub App

Install our `GitHub App`. We will be commenting back the test results via the app.

<Tip>
  Install the GitHub App from here https://github.com/apps/octomind-dev.

  />
</Frame>

### 4. Allow GitHub Comments

We’ll ask you to grant access to your repository to read metadata & read and write access to pull requests so we are allowed to comment back into pull requests. It will list the test results with additional links to more details, looking like this ↓

    alt="Example of Octomind test results in a pull request comment"
  />
</Frame>

Previous comments by octomind with test results will be collapsed by default. You can click to expand them.

  />
</Frame>

We are very cautious about the permissions we need to protect your IP. We won’t need any other permissions.

<Info>We won’t be able to see your code.</Info>

### 5. Include the GitHub Action

Include the following `GitHub Action` into your CI/CD build pipeline on pull request.

```yaml
- uses: OctoMind-dev/automagically-action-execute@v2
  with:
    url: <publicly accessible url to your deployment>
    token: ${{ secrets.AUTOMAGICALLY_TOKEN }}
    testTargetId: <your testTargetId that you also get from us>
    blocking: <if you want your pipeline to wait for all tests to pass>
    environmentName: <if you want to run tests on environment other than default>
```

<div class="mt-8" />

<Warning>
  Please make sure to integrate the GibHub action **AFTER** your deployment
  step.
</Warning>

We assume you are running branch deployments so that every change can be tested in isolation. Please inject the publicly accessible url of your branch deployment, testTargetId and API key.

<div className="mt-8" />

<Tip>
