## CI/CD pipeline integration

In order to integrate Octomind into your CI/CD pipeline, you will need a GitHub Action and a GitHub App.

### 1. Setup CI Github Action

Include the following `GitHub Action` into your CI/CD build pipeline on pull request.
See [git action docs](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-action-execute) for more details

```yaml
- uses: OctoMind-dev/automagically-action-execute@v2
  with:
    url: <publicly accessible url to your deployment>
    token: ${{ secrets.OCTOMIND_API_KEY }}
    testTargetId: <your testTargetId from your octomind project>
    blocking: false
```

<Warning>
  Please make sure to integrate the GitHub action **AFTER** your deployment
  step. You have to link octomind to your publicly accessible app / branch
  deployment url to run tests on it.
</Warning>

### 2. Install GitHub App

<Info>
  We need read and write access to pull requests ONLY so we are allowed to
  comment back with test results. We won't be able to see your code.
</Info>

<Tip>
  Install the GitHub App from here https://github.com/apps/octomind-dev.

### 3. See it in action

Octomind automatically runs tests on your pull request, and comments with a summary in your PR.
