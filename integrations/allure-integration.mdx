You can connect Octomind to your **allure test management system** to keep all testing results in one place.
You can also import test descriptions to seamlessly convert manual tests into automated ones.

As Allure Report is simply based on JSON files, you can use the open source repository 
[Allure Report](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/allure-report) to convert your Octomind test report into Allure JSON files.
