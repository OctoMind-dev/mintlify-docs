### 1. Create an API key

<Snippet file="snippet-apiKey.mdx" />

### 2. Copy your test target ID

<Snippet file="snippet-testTarget.mdx" />

### 3. Adding webhook

<Warning>
  If you have a way to trigger your pipeline already, you can skip this step.
</Warning>

Select your repository `Settings`, go to `Webhooks` and click `Add webhook.`

</Frame>

For the URL set `<your-jenkins-url>/github-webhook/` and select `application/json` for Content type.
Select triggers that best suite your need.
In general, the `push event` is enough, but for this example we also want to trigger Octomind on `pull request`.

Check `Pull requests` and `Pushes` and after that click on `Add webhook`.

If everything is OK, you should see a green checkmark after a few moments.

### 4. Jenkins

An example Jenkinsfile can be found [here](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/jenkins-integration/blob/main/Jenkinsfile).
Copy that code to the desired step in your pipeline.

Add your `AUTOMAGICALLY_TOKEN` to your secrets. Navigate to `Dashboard -> Manage jenkins -> Credentials -> System -> Global credentials (unrestricted)` and click on `Add Credentials`.
For the `Kind` you need to select `Secret text`. Be careful that your `ID` matches the `ID` that you call within the Jenkinsfile script. Copy your token value to the `Secret` field and click `Create`.

<Tip>
  AUTOMAGICALLY_TOKEN is API key created in [first step](#1-create-an-api-key).
</Tip>

If you want, you can enable safe parsing of HTML so you can click the link to the test report the pipeline output for you.
Navigate to `Dashboard -> Manage jenkins -> Security` and for `Markup Formatter` select `Safe HTML` and then save.

### Creating Jenkins pipeline

Here is an example of creating a pipeline to test the script.

On your Dashboard page, click on `+ New Item`

<Frame caption="Creating new Pipeline, Jenkins 2.401.2">

</Frame>

Give your Project a name, select Pipeline and press OK

</Frame>

You can check `GitHub project` and paste an url to your repo so you will have a button on your dashboard to take you to your repo.
You need to check `GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling` so our previously created hook can trigger our pipeline.

For the `Definition` select `Pipeline script from SCM`.
For `SCM` you select `Git`
After adding your `Repository URL`, you'll need to provide credentials if it's a private repository.

You'll need to specify a branch, in this example `*/*` will trigger the pipeline on pushing to any branch.
If you want to trigger pipeline only on specific branch changes, e.g. main, put in `*/main`.
The last field asks you to set the path and name to Jenkinsfile, but it's on the top level in our repository and it's named Jenkinsfile, so no changes are required.
Lastly, click on `Save`.
