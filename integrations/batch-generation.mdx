## Overview

This GitHub Action connects to OctoMind's services to generate a batch of end-to-end tests based on your application. It can be configured to run against specific environments, use prerequisites, and target specific URLs.

## Prerequisites

- An OctoMind account with access to the API
- A valid OctoMind API key (generated from the [OctoMind app](https://app.octomind.dev))
- Your OctoMind test target ID

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Add API Key to Repository Secrets

First, add your OctoMind API key to your GitHub repository secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
3. Click on "New repository secret"
4. Name the secret `OCTOMIND_API_KEY`
5. Paste your OctoMind API key as the value
6. Click "Add secret"

### 2. Add the GitHub Action to Your Workflow

Add the following YAML snippet to your GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/octomind-tests.yml`):

```yml
name: OctoMind Test Generation

on:
  # Configure when you want the action to run
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  # You can also run it manually
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  generate-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      # Add any steps needed to deploy your application to a test environment
      # ...
      
      - name: Generate OctoMind Tests
        uses: OctoMind-dev/octomind-action-batch-generation@main
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.OCTOMIND_API_KEY }}
          testTargetId: your-test-target-id
          baseUrl: https://your-deployment-url.example.com
          # Optional parameters
          # entrypointUrlPath: /some/path
          # environmentId: your-environment-id
          # prerequisiteId: your-prerequisite-test-id
```

## Configuration Options

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `token` | Yes | Your OctoMind API key, stored as a GitHub secret |
| `testTargetId` | Yes | The ID of your test target in OctoMind |
| `baseUrl` | No | A publicly accessible URL to your deployment. If not provided, defaults to the URL in your default environment |
| `entrypointUrlPath` | No | A specific URL path to be appended to your base URL (e.g., `/some/path`) |
| `environmentId` | No | ID of a specific environment to run the tests against |
| `prerequisiteId` | No | ID of a test case that should be executed before batch generation (e.g., login test) |

## Use Cases

### Generate Tests on Pull Request

Automatically generate tests whenever a pull request is created or updated to ensure new features are properly tested.

The action will comment on the pull request with the test results.

  />
</Frame>

### Generate Tests After Deployment

Trigger test generation after deploying to a staging environment to validate the deployment.

### Generate Tests with Prerequisites

Use prerequisite tests (like login flows) before generating new tests to ensure proper authentication.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the GitHub Action:

1. Verify your API key is correctly set in the repository secrets
2. Ensure your `testTargetId` is correct
3. Check that the `baseUrl` is publicly accessible
4. Review GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
