You can connect Octomind to your **Zephyr test management system** to keep all testing results in one place. You can also import test descriptions to seamlessly convert manual tests into automated ones.

## Connect to Zephyr

Go to your organization `settings` and choose the tab `integrations`.

Enter your **project key** and **API token** to establish the connection. Once connected, test results from your Octomind test runs will be automatically synchronized back to Zephyr, keeping your test management system up to date with the latest test execution results.
