Octomind supports Playwright [extraHTTPHeaders](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-extra-http-headers). Those headers are configurable on a project level. Open the Settings dialog to start setting custom header fields.

### Purpose and Functionality

- depending on your service you might use custom headers to disable bot protection or trigger app specific behavior
- once configured we'll forward the extra http headers with every request.
