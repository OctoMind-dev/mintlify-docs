# Overview

In the overview, you can observe the **name** of the test case, its **last run**, **run time** and view an **autoplay slideshow** demonstrating
how AI executed your commands.

# Steps

The Steps section enables you to **review each step** executed by your AI, allowing you to click on any step to view the
previously shown slideshow.

It is important to note that you **can not** edit steps; you can only **view** them.

# Debug

In the test results, the **Debug** feature includes a new functionality compared to other debug options: the `Inspect in
Trace Viewer` button. Clicking on this button opens the Playwright Trace Viewer window.
