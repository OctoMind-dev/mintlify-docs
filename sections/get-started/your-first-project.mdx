To create your first project, **you need to complete the sign up flow.** Follow next steps:

# 1. Give us URL

We'll ask for a URL to create test cases. The URL has to be publicly accessible.

## 2. Name your project

The second page will render a screenshot of the url you provided. It tests that your URL is accessible. If it's not, you'll see an Octo in a jar.
Now you'd need to give your project a name. We'll propose one similar to the url you provided.
But you can choose your own.

**log in**
- this test assesses login functionality, verifying credential accuracy and security, to ensure a seamless and secure user access
- if you choose the log in test, we’ll ask you for test user credentials (test username and a password). The test credentials should fit the URL you provided above

**only custom**
- note that a reachability test is always active by default. Selecting any test will execute it in conjunction with the
reachability test
- choosing the “only custom” option will run just the reachability test
- additionally, later in the application, you have the flexibility to conduct your own test regardless of the options previously selected
