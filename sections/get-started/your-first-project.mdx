To create your first project, **you need to complete the sign up flow.**

# 1. Give us URL

We will ask for a URL to create the test cases for. The URL has to be publicly accessible.

## 2. Name your project

We will render a screenshot of the URL you provided. We test that your URL is accessible.

You also need to give your project a name. We will propose one similar to the URL you provided, but you can choose your own.

## 3. Preselect test cases

During the first set-up, you have an option to select which [drafts](/sections/get-started/octo-dictionary/#test-case) will wait for you once you finish the sign up.

By default, we will include our reachability test and you can choose between `log in`, `change language` or `links`.

Select `only custom` if you prefer to have clean state once you are inside the app and ready to start the testing journey.

<Tip>You can even select all three of them</Tip>

**log in**

- our AI Agent generates [steps](/sections/get-started/octo-dictionary/#test-steps) to perform login action.
- you also need provide the test user credentials.
- make sure the account has the minimal privileges necessary to perform the login function, we do not want to potentially mess with your data.
- if your website is login protected we highly recommend to select this option because of[ test case dependency](/sections/get-started/octo-dictionary/#test-case-dependency) option

**change language**

- our AI Agent generates [steps](/sections/get-started/octo-dictionary/#test-steps) to perform language switching action

**links**

- our AI Agent generates multiple [drafts](/sections/get-started/octo-dictionary/#test-case) where each test case verifies the accessibility of link on the page

Congratulations, you have finished the sign up flow!
Once you confirm the email, you will be redirected to a page to establish your account credentials after which you will be able to access the app.
Your tests will be waiting for you!
