The idea of Octomind is to have e2e tests (draper-san to add our vision).

Ideally, you already have your app's flows that you want to test.
You create a new test case, by using currently provided options which are prompt, recording and manually.
Once the draft test case is created, you play around in the steps rail until you are satisfied with the steps taken and the outcome of the run and then you publish it.
You repeat the process for all the flows you had in mind.
Finally, you generate the report where you can see the outcome of the tests that are being ran.
Lastly, you integrate us into your CI, so the report generation happens on every pull request.case

The above explained vision can be presented as diagram below:
