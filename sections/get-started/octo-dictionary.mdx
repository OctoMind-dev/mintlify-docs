## Test case

It is important to understand that a test case can exist only in three distinct forms:

- **draft**, once test is created
- **published**, once you publish draft
- **archived**, once you remove either draft or published test

## Test report

Reporting a test involves obtaining the **test results** of whole published test cases section. Action triggers once
**generate report** button is pressed.

## Project

**Each time you execute an existing URL, we generate a new project based on that URL.** All subsequent tests and actions
are conducted within the context of the provided URL.

## Test steps

Each of our tests contains of **steps.** This structure is integral to our system, and these steps are editable if your test
is in draft form. You can conceptualize steps as instructions you would give to a human, except here, you are communicating with a computer.

## Running test case

The same process occurs as when generating a test report, but here, you can perform it on an **individual test** rather than
the entire published section.

## Prompt

## Recording

## Manual test case

## Run locally

Running locally **is part of debugging your code.** Upon activation, you will receive the command necessary to be copied
and pasted into your terminal.

Further details will be elaborated on in the **Published test cases / Archived test cases** section.
