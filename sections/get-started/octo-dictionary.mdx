## Project

Project is a collection of test cases and test reports specific to the URL you provided.
That URL is used as a base for every further action within the octomind app and you can extend it for a specific path (e.g. /docs) as a start URL for a specific test.

You also have an option to run your test collection against different environment or, with help of [Debugtopus](/sections/get-started/octo-dictionary/#debugtopus), against localhost / local changes (needs wording).

You can always create another project if you need to test multiple web sites, but the tests won't be shared between them.

## Test steps

Test step is our building block. It models minimal action within the test, e.g. _click on a button_ or _check if the button is visible_. (should eg be in italic)

## Test case

Test case is octomind base entity. It is an ordered chain of test steps. A test case can have multiple states:

1. **draft:** test case ends up in draft state after being created. While test case is in draft state, you can add/remove steps to fulfil your testing goal
2. **published:** once you're happy with your test case's steps, you can publish it. Published test cases will be included into test report
3. **archived:** test case is archived once you click remove button on published test case.
   This excludes the test case from future test reports and we keep them as archived in case you change your mind

Both the draft and the published test case can be run to see what will be the outcome of execution of that test case.
Neither of these produces a test report, it is more like validation that steps within them are executable.

## Test result

Test result is an outcome of execution of test case.
It can be successful or failed, depending if the assertions are met.
It can also end up in error state which indicates that there is a problem on our side.

## Test report

Test report consists of test results which are outcome of executing published test cases.

## Running test case

At this point of time, running a test case can mean three things:

1.  run a specific test case in specific state which does not produce a test report
2.  run all the published test cases which produces the test report
3.  [run locally](/sections/get-started/octo-dictionary/#run-locally)

## Run locally

By running locally we mean that we want to execute the test case's steps against the URL you provide within the [Debugtopus](/sections/get-started/octo-dictionary/#debugtopus) command.
Intended use case is when your test case is failed and you want to fix the problem and test it against your local environment (better wording ty)

## Prompt

Prompt refers to a text input to our AI Agent which will then come up with test steps from it.

## Recording

This option is for our tech savvy users who are already familiar with Playwright. Sometimes our AI Agent may not be able to generate desired steps,
but these steps can easily be generated through Playwright recorder. Our API is able to parse most of the Playwright's selectors and assertions.

## Manual test case

Manual test case refers to an action of creating a draft with no steps in it.
It is on the user to manually add all the steps through our UI from supported assertions and interactions.
It is intended for users who want maximal control.

## Debugtopus

Debugtopus is our open source tool enabling you to run tests locally for easier debugging.

## Test Case dependency

When a flow (e.g. check if my profile name is visible) is dependent on another flow (e.g. log in -> you need to be logged in to see your profile), you can create a test case
which will have all the necessary steps to perform a log in and then steps to go to "my profile" and check if name is visible.
On the other hand, steps needed to perform a login can be a test case on its own, and then your "check my profile name is visible" test case can depend on it, meaning before
executing steps of "check my profile name is visible", do "log in" steps first to end up in state. Or to put it shorter: concat steps of "log in" and "check if my profile name is visible".
