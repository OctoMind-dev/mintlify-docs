<Warning>
  If you are using a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to Vercel with your own
  .yml files, check out our [Quickstart - GitHub Actions
  guide](https://docs.octomind.dev/quickstart-GitHub) instead.
</Warning>

## CI/CD pipeline integration

We currently do not have a native Vercel integration. If you are using Vercel for your CI, you should be able to use Octomind when following the steps below. If you have any difficulties with it, please, let us know on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3ShnZMKRfA).

<Tip>
  See also our [example vercel-actions integration
  repo](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/vercel-actions-example).

### 1. Create an API key

### 2. Copy your test target ID

### 3. Include the GitHub Action

Include the following `GitHub Action` into your CI/CD build pipeline on deployment_status changes:

```yaml
on: deployment_status

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  octomind:
    if: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.state  == 'success' }}
    name: 🚀🐙 trigger octomind e2e tests 🚀🐙
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: OctoMind-dev/automagically-action-execute@v2
        with:
          testTargetId: "<yourTestTargetId>"
          url: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}
          token: ${{ secrets.OCTOMIND_TOKEN }}
```

The test report link will be added to the workflow summary of the action, see [Example PR action summary](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/vercel-actions-example/pull/11)
