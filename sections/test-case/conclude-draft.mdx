# Overview

In the overview layout, you can observe: **date** of your draft creation, **name** of the test case, **URL** you provided, and its **last run.**

The actions you can perform include:
- **deleting the draft** by clicking on the delete icon located in the top right corner
- **renaming** the test case
- pressing **last run**, which will redirect you to a new page where you can view the test report in Playwright Trace Viewer

Last run presents the result of the previous action of pressing the `run` button.

# Steps

**Steps** represent the list of commands you provided to our AI agent.

You can **edit** your prompts by clicking on the pencil icon displayed in the top right container.

**Regenerating** steps can be done by clicking on the `generate steps` button and confirming the action.

In the "body" of steps, there are **two** options available:
- you can **click** on a **step** and mark it as optional, allowing the app to continue running even if it fails at that step
- you can **click** on the **plus** icon to add a new step, where you can choose whether it should be an interaction or an assertion.
