# Draft

Once test cases is created, it is in **draft** status, where it can be edited, reviewed, run or published.

# Published

Once test case draft if published, it will be included into further test reports.
If the published test cases needs a change, you can always edit it, which will put it back to draft status.

# Archived

If you delete the published test case, it will end up in archived tab, just in case you change your mind.
You can also restore the archived test case, which will put the test case back to draft where you can.
