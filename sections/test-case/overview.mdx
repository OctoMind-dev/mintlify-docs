# Draft

Once you create **new test**, your test goes into **draft** form

# Published

You have the option to **publish** your draft, transitioning the test from **draft** to **published** form. The only way to
turn your draft into a published form is by publishing the draft itself.

# Archived

You can **archive** your test case by either **deleting** the draft or **excluding** the published version. Outcome is identical;
the test case will transition from its original form to an archived form.

You **can** access to **all archived test cases** in your archived section.
