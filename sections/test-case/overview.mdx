# Draft

Once test case is created, it is in **draft** status, where it can be edited, reviewed, run or published.

# Published

Once draft test case is published, it will be included into every further test reports.
If the published test cases needs a change, you can always edit it, which will put it back to draft status.

# Archived

Once you no longer want your published test case to be a part of future test report, you exclude it.
All existing test reports will not be updated.
The test case will end up in archived tab, just in case you change your mind.
Therefore you can restore the archived test case, which will put the test case back to draft status.
