# Prompt

**Prompt** refers to a text input to our AI Agent which will then try to come up with test steps from it.

# Recording

This option is for our tech savvy users who are already familiar with **Playwright.** Sometimes our AI Agent will no be able
to generate steps you wish, but these steps can easily be generated through Playwright recorder. Our API is able to parse
most of the Playwright recorded selectors and assertions.

# Manual

**Manual** test case refers to an action of creating a draft with no steps in it. It is on the user to manually add all the
steps through our UI from supported assertions and interactions. It is intended for users who want maximal control.
