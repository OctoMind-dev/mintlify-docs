When creating a new test case, you need to provide it with the name and optionally starting endpoint.
This helps when your test does not start at the homepage but in some specific route.
This way we reduce the boilerplate needed to get to the place you actually want to test.

You can select one of the three following ways to generate steps:

- [**prompt**](/sections/get-started/octo-dictionary/#prompt)
- [**recording**](/sections/get-started/octo-dictionary/#recording)
- [**manual**](/sections/get-started/octo-dictionary/#manual-test-case)

# Prompt

<Info>
  Entering a prompt temporarily disables option to switch to other options until
  the prompt field is cleared
</Info>

Before entering the prompt for your desired flow, you have option to choose a dependency first.
This comes quite handy when there are pre-requisites to the flow you want to test.
For example, lets say your app requires login, so instead including "first perform a login" to your prompt, you can preselect the login test, assuming you created that test case separately before.
That way, our AI Agent will first go through dependent steps before trying to continue with generation of steps from the provided prompt.

<Note>Only published test cases can be selected as pre-requisite</Note>

Clicking the save button will trigger our AI Agent to start generating test case steps.
This may take a while, but step generation this way is streamed so you can see (needs wording)

# Recording

<Info>
  Inserting code temporarily disables option to switch to other options until
  the code field is cleared
</Info>

After making sure you have Playwright installed, you can execute given command and record steps for your flow.

Here is a quick recording example used to navigate to docs:

```TypeScript
await page.getByLabel('help-menu').click();
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'documentation' }).click();
```

If there is something wrong in syntax, you will not be able to save the test case.
You will be informed by the snackbar that test case could not be created and in the code console, the line that is causing problem will be underlined.

Clicking the save button will instantly create a draft.

# Manual

By selecting the manual option, you can only click the save button since it will create a draft with no steps in it.
