### 2024-07-11

- `Automatic login and cookie banner tests` at sign-up. When you sign up to Octomind or create new project (add a new URL):

1. AI agent goes through your site and checks for cookie banners.
2. If a cookie banner is present, it creates a cookie banner test.
3. AI agent checks if you have a login at your site.
4. If you do, it asks you for test credentials.
5. You give it your test credentials.
6. AI agent auto-generates a login test.
7. The cookie and the login tests will be populated into all new auto-generated tests as dependencies.
