title: AI discovery (alpha)

We are deploying an `AI agent` to discover user flows and interactions leading towards a desired user goal.
It is the foundation for creating `deterministic test cases`. We are recording and storing the interaction chain of a test case in an intermediate representation.
Playwright code is generated on the fly just before test execution.

## Free prompting

We have released our free prompting interface for everyone to try it out as an alpha release. It will help us fine tune the AI agent and the self-serve experience.
[Sign up to our app](https://app.octomind.dev/setup/url?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=txt-lnk) and get the first UI test automatically.

<Info>
  The ultimate goal is to streamline the AI discovery process, so the initial
  test creation effort is minimal and test self-healing fully automated.
  Prompting will become fully automated for more and more test cases as we go.

## Free prompting best practices - work in progress

1. Keep prompts short and to the point.
2. Mention all steps required, e.g. if you have to click away a cookie banner, mention it.

- Example without a cookie banner: “sign in with username and password using \{credentials\}”
- Example with a cookie banner: “accept cookies then sign in with username and password using \{credentials\}”

3. These are the limitations so far:

- We can only handle flows which happen inside the app. Cross-app or cross-device flows are not supported, e.g. we do not cover email confirmation flow or a 2FA right now.
- We cannot handle captchas yet.
- Our AI agent might get blocked by robot detection on some high traffic sites. Sites / apps in production are more bot-protected than staging / test systems.
- We are not able to stack test cases yet. We always start at 0. If your test case wants to add/remove devices from a list, you might have to include the sign-in procedure as well.
