A project is a collection of test cases and test reports tied to a website or webapp. The URL you define for it is used as a basis for generating test case steps. You can extend it to subpaths of your website during test case creation. While running test reports the URL is templates, this allows you to run your test cases against multiple deployments of the same application.

Projects are listed in the left menu bar underneath your organisation. The active project is shown in the top menu to the right
of the organisation.

You can always create another project if you need to test multiple web sites. The tests won't be shared between them.
