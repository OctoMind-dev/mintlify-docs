A project is a collection of test cases and test reports tied to a url, the test target. The URL is used as a base for every
further action within the Octomind app and you can extend it for a specific path (e.g. /docs) as a start URL for a specific test.

Projects are listed in the left menu bar underneath your organisation. The active project is shown in the top menu to the right
of the organisation.

You can always create another project if you need to test multiple web sites. The tests won't be shared between them.
