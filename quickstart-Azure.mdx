## CI/CD Pipeline Integration

1. Install our Azure DevOps [Pipelines Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octomind.automagically-execute-task)

2. Include the following `Azure DevOps Task` into your CI/CD build pipeline on pull request: [Source Code](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-azure-devops-task-execute)
   We assume you are running branch deployments so that every change can be tested in isolation.
   We will provide you a **token / api key** via email to trigger your test suite. It will look similar to this: sk-12345678.abcdefg123. You will inject the publicly accessible url of your branch deployment and the token / api key via the azure task. We provide a separate token for each project.

 ```yml
  - task: automagicallyexecute@1
    inputs:
      url:
      token: ${{ secrets.AUTOMAGICALLY_TOKEN }}
 ```
</Frame>

3. Make sure that your build service user also has permissions to comment to pull requests. To do so navigate to the
Project Settings > Repos > Repositories > Security tab and allow the contribute to pull request flag.

4. During installation, we’ll ask you to grant access to your repository with write access to pull request threads, so we are allowed to comment back into the pipeline. It will list the test results with additional links to more details, looking like this ↓

<Tip>**We won’t need any other permissions. We won’t be able to see your code.**</Tip>

## Test Suite Setup

5. We will compose the test suite for you. In this way, we’ll learn about the complexities and adjust our discovery technology to cover your user flows. Playwright code will be generated on the fly for execution and in a later iteration for download. Feel free to download the code and use it as you see fit.

#### What we need from you to setup the test suite

| parameter     | format              | explanation                                                                                                         |
|---|---|---|
| test target   | string              | Display name - description of your test suite                                                                       |
| discovery url | url                 | The url we can use to discover the initial set of test cases                                                        |
| dev account   | username & password | User account to your deployed app in your dev system which we can use for test discovery as well as executing tests |

## Test Runs

6. Tests will be hosted by Octomind and executed by Octomind on pull request. For now, please, expect a delay before you receive your test results. Success will be reported immediately. Failures will be reviewed manually to learn failure reasons and to make sure we avoid false positives to the greatest extent possible.
