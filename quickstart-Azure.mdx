### 4. Include the Azure DevOps Task

Include the following `Azure DevOps Task` into your CI/CD build pipeline on pull
request.
We assume you are running branch deployments so that every change can be tested in isolation.
You will have to inject the publicly accessible URL of your branch deployment and the API key via
the azure task.

```yml
- task: automagicallyexecute@1
  inputs:
    url:
    token: ${{ secrets.AUTOMAGICALLY_TOKEN }}
```

<div class="mt-8" />

<Warning>
  Please make sure to integrate the AzureDevOps Task **AFTER** your deployment
  step.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  The Azure DevOps Task is published here: [source
  code](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-azure-devops-task-execute)
</Tip>

### 5. Set user permissions

Make sure that your `build service user` also has permissions to comment to pull requests. To do so, navigate to the
Project Settings > Repos > Repositories > Security tab and allow the 'contribute to pull request' flag.

### 6. Allow comments

During installation, we’ll ask you to grant access to your repository with write access to pull request threads, so we are
allowed to comment back into the pipeline. It will list the test results with additional links to more details, looking like this ↓

  />
</Frame>

<div class="mt-8" />

<Info>
  We won’t need any other permissions. We won’t be able to see your code.
