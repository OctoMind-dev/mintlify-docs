## CI/CD pipeline integration

### 1. Create an APIKey

<Snippet file="snippet-apiKey.mdx" />

### 2. Copy your testTargetId

3. Install our Azure DevOps [pipelines extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octomind.automagically-execute-task)

4. Include the following `Azure DevOps Task` into your CI/CD build pipeline on pull request - [source code](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-azure-devops-task-execute).
   We assume you are running branch deployments so that every change can be tested in isolation.
   We will provide you a **token / api key** via email to trigger your test suite. It will look similar to this: _sk-12345678.abcdefg123_. You will inject the publicly accessible URL of your branch deployment and the token / api key via the azure task. We provide a separate token for each project.

 ```yml
  - task: automagicallyexecute@1
    inputs:
      url:
      token: ${{ secrets.AUTOMAGICALLY_TOKEN }}
 ```
</Frame>

5. Make sure that your **build service user** also has permissions to comment to pull requests. To do so, navigate to the
   Project Settings > Repos > Repositories > Security tab and allow the 'contribute to pull request' flag.

6. During installation, we’ll ask you to grant access to your repository with write access to pull request threads, so we are allowed to comment back into the pipeline. It will list the test results with additional links to more details, looking like this ↓

<Tip>
  **We won’t need any other permissions. We won’t be able to see your code.**
