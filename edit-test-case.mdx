## Edit steps

There are many ways how you can fix, update or enhance an existing test case by editing its steps.

### Change locator

Did the AI agent address the wrong locator? Did you change a flow in the app and you have to point to a different element?

- Go to the snapshot of the relevant test step
- Hover over the **virtual locator picker**
- Click `change locator`
- Select a different locator with your mouse in the snapshot

### Change locator type

Use the **virtual locator picker** to change the type of the locator. Your options are:

- `interactions` - enter text, press key, select option, click
- `assertions` - visible, hidden, disabled, have value

### Add and remove steps

Click on `add step` and drag the `new step` to its respective place in the step sequence. The snapshot will adapt so you can use the **virtual locator picker** to select the interaction or assertion type.

Delete steps by clicking on the `trash` icon in the upper right corner of the test step view.

### Drag & drop, duplicate and copy paste steps

Octomind test steps can be flexibly manipulated. You can **drag and drop** steps to different places in the sequence, duplicate them by clicking on the `duplicate` icon in the upper right corner or simply `select` a step and **copy & paste** it where you need it. `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` works also for copy pasting steps from other test cases.

## Edit prompt and restart AI auto-generation

You can edit the prompt and have the AI agent `regenerate` test steps based on the new prompt. We will ask you to select **the last step** in the sequence you want to keep. The AI agent will regenerate test steps from this step onwards.

Or you have simply hit the `regenerate` button to rediscover the steps based on the same prompt.

## Edit dependencies

Click on the `refresh` icon next to the existing **test dependency** and select a more suitable option to chain your test with.

## Run and save edits

`Run` you test case to see if it works. If it's successful, you can click on the `save` button. We will warn you if you try to leave without saving the test.

<Tip>
  Double check that your newly edited step is `on` in the test case view if you
  want to run it in your next **test report**.
