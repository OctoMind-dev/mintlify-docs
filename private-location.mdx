## Overview

</Frame>

The Private Location Worker allows customers to include non-publicly available applications in Octomind discovery and test execution. It is run by the customer within their private network, enabling it to reach internal applications for testing.

The worker acts as a combination of a proxy and tunneling mechanism, connecting the private network with the Octomind platform. This feature ensures secure access to applications hosted behind firewalls or other private environments.

## Features

### Tunneling with FRP
- The tunneling is managed using [FRP](https://github.com/fatedier/frp), connecting the worker’s frp-client to Octomind’s proxy servers (EU or US).
- Requires access permission to specific public IPs: `35.192.162.70` or `34.159.153.198`.

### Access to Private Web Applications
- The embedded Squid proxy server allows requests from the private network, mimicking public proxy requests from within the customer’s network.
  
### Test Execution and Discovery
- After registering the worker with Octomind, users can configure the proxy location for executing discovery or test runs.

## Configuration

The Private Location Worker can be configured using environment variables:

- **API-KEY**: API key from the Octomind platform.
- **NAME**: Worker name displayed in the Octomind platform.
- **PROXY_USER**: Proxy username.
- **PROXY_PASS**: Proxy password.
- **SERVER_ADDR**: Tunnel server address (default: `35.159.153.198`).

## Security Considerations

- The container image is open-source, allowing customers to review and build their own versions. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/private-location-worker).
- Network access can be restricted to the tunnel server and test targets.
- The Squid proxy requires authentication, ensuring secure access.
