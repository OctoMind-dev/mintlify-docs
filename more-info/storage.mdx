Octomind supports storing data in preferred regional storage.

You can select the storage location in the settings of your project.

The storage location is used for storing test results (screenshots and page snapshots) and traces.
Independently of the storage location, test results are always deleted after 60 days.

<Info>
  Default storage location is `europe-west3 (Frankfurt)`. To change the storage
  location you need to switch to a paid plan and go to the settings of your
  project.
