Octomind is supporting a variety of different CI/CD providers.
We provide native integrations for GitHub and Azure DevOps. They allow us to comment back into your pipeline.
For all other providers we currently only provide an API to trigger test runs.

You can always see results in our app https://app.octomind.dev.

## Open sourced integrations

Octomind integrations are all open source. We'd encourage you to contribute to the existing or compose new integrations for other CI/CD providers.
We'll happily take over and maintain them further.

Check out this 2 minute video on how Octomind works when integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.
The example is using a GitHub Action.
