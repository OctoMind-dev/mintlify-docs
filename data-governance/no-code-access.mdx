## No code access

We operate by simulating a real user interacting with your web app, using your app's DOM to identify actions like clicks or text
inputs. We are also using screenshots. This doesn't require access to your code base. We are only seeing the parts of your app
which are exposed to your users anyways.
Hence, we are not jeopardizing any SOC2 or ISO compliance requirements you might need to follow.

## GDPR compliance

We are not GDPR relevant since we are not collecting any user data (privacy relevant or not). You can strictly run
Octomind on test data to make sure, your are not violating your own compliance requirements.

## One IP address

If you need to set your firewall to allow our agent to exercise your web app, please use this IP address: `35.192.162.70`

<Warning>
  Please let us know so that we can set your organisation to always use our
  proxy. We do not have this option as self-service yet.
</Warning>

## Metrics

In case you need to exclude our agent from your metrics you can easily do this by excluding any browsers with a user agent
extension of `octomind`.

## CI/CD Integration

You might want to integrate Ocotmind into your development workflows. To do so, you can use our various [CI/CD integrations](/integrations-overview).

Our integrations initiate your test suite runs, requiring an `API key`, `test target ID` and `target URL`.

- The `API key` identfies your organization
- The `test target ID` identfies your test suite
- Tests are performed on the `target URL`

`API key` and `test target ID` can be received from the settings section of Octomind.

Our GitHub and Azure DevOps integration are bi-directional. They trigger test runs and comment results back into your pipeline during pull requests.
These only require comment permissions. Please check out the respective section in our documentation for more details.

<Tip>
  Both tools are open source, you can view their repositories at [GitHub Action
  repository](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-action-execute) and
  [Azure DevOps Task
  repository](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-azure-devops-task-execute)
  to run an audit.
</Tip>

Other intergrations into Vercel, Jenkins or the curl command are not able to comment back. Hence they do not need permissions.

## Run locally

We provide an option to run test cases locally from your dev machine against any test target. You can either run a single test
case or all of them at once. To do so, please check out [Debug failed test cases](/debugtopus). Since this component is running
on your local machine its code is open sourced so that you can run an audit on it. This is the
[Debugtopus repository on GitHub](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/debugtopus).

## NDA

If you want us to sign an NDA you can find all information in our [NDA section](/data-governance/nda).
