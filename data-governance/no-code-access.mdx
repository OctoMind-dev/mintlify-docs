We operate by simulating a real user interacting with your web app, using your app's DOM to identify actions like clicks or text inputs. This doesn't require access to your code.

Our [GitHub Action](/quickstart-GitHub) or [Azure DevOps Task](/quickstart-Azure) initiates your test suite, requiring an `API key`, `test target ID` and `target URL`.

- The **API key** identfies your organization
- The **test target ID** identfies your test suite
- Tests are performed on the **target URL**

<Tip>
  Both tools are open source, you can view their repositories at ([GitHub Action
  repository](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-action-execute),
  [Azure DevOps Task
  repository](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-azure-devops-task-execute))
</Tip>

Test results are provided as comments in your CI/CD pipeline during a `pull request`, using a GitHub App and an Azure DevOps Extension. These only require comment permissions.
