We operate by simulating a real user interacting with your web app, using your app's DOM to identify actions like clicks or text inputs. This doesn't require access to your code.

Our [GitHub Action](/quickstart-GitHub) or [Azure DevOps Task](/quickstart-Azure) initiates your test suite, requiring only an API token and target URL.
- The **api token** identfies your test suite
- Tests are performed on the **target url**

<Tip>Both of these tools are open source, with their repositories found at the provided links, for your review.
([GitHub Action repository](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-action-execute),
[Azure DevOps Task repository](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-azure-devops-task-execute))</Tip>
 

Test results are provided as comments in your CI/CD pipeline during a Pull Request, using a GitHub App and an Azure DevOps App. These only require comment permissions.
