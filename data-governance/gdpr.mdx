At Octomind, we take data privacy and security seriously and follow best practices to ensure that our customers' data is handled responsibly. We only collect and process data as necessary to deliver our core services, such as website testing, and we do not share any data with third parties outside of essential service providers like infrastructure providers.

We maintain a clear data retention policy, ensuring that all user data related to tests is deleted after six weeks, with the exception of essential user profiles that facilitate service continuity. All data is processed solely for the intended purpose of delivering and improving our services, and we strive to uphold the principles of data minimization, purpose limitation, and security. To ensure clients' needs are fully met, we are open to discussing any specific privacy or security concerns and are happy to sign a mutual NDA if needed.

Client data is protected in the following ways:

- **No data collection**: We do not collect or store any customer data beyond what is necessary for test case creation and execution.
- **Data processing**: HTML and screenshots are analyzed during the test creation process. HTML is never stored, and screenshots are kept as part of the test report, following our data retention policy.
- **Data retention**: Test runs generate traces and screenshots, which are used solely in test reports to help users understand the quality of the system. All artifacts (such as traces and screenshots) are automatically deleted after six weeks as part of our standard deletion policy.
- **Security**: Industry-standard security measures, such as encryption and secure access protocols, are implemented to ensure data confidentiality and protection.

Our solution only uses input data for the purpose of composing, running, and maintaining test cases. We do not use this data to train our solution, nor do we share input or output data with third-party companies outside of our standard service providers, such as AWS, Azure or GCP, which are necessary for infrastructure purposes.

Human inspections of input or output data are not systematically conducted unless explicitly requested for support purposes. In such cases, only authorized support personnel have access, solely for the specific purpose of resolving issues. We analyze system failures, especially if our AI agent encounters difficulties during test case creation. These inspections are limited to individual test cases or specific steps within test cases and are carried out only by authorized support personnel.

Output data (such as Playwright code) generated by our solution is not subject to third-party rights, nor are there limitations on your use of the generated code. Clients have full access to the Playwright code, which they can use as needed.

The source code generated by Octomind is not available in any public repositories and is not subject to external licensing. Our solution generates an intermediate representation (a data structure describing user flows, such as "click on T-shirt," "select size M," etc.), which is then deterministically converted into Playwright code without the use of AI. The generated Playwright code is fully owned by the client, with no external license requirements.
