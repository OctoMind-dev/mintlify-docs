`Red` signals the test has failed. This is due to 3 reasons:

## 1. **You have a bug in your app**

We will pinpoint you to the exact moment where it broke. We will [pre-classify a possible root cause of the failure](/maintain-tests/inspect-broken-tests#we-have-classified-the-root-cause-of-the-broken-test), give you [timeline of what happended during test execution](/maintain-tests/inspect-broken-tests#inspect-what-happened-in-one-single-place) and the ability to [compare with previous successful runs](/maintain-tests/inspect-broken-tests#compare-the-broken-test-with-previous-successful-test-runs).

For an even more precise debugging, you can launch the **trace viewer** or our open source [Debugtopus](/run-tests/execution-local) to use locally on your machine.

## 2. **The test is broken**

End-to-end tests tend to break when the app changes. This is not just annoying, but a major time investment.

With the help of our [test inspection and debugging tools](/maintain-tests/inspect-broken-tests), you'll easily detect the cuplprit and the Agent will even suggest an [auto-fix of the broken test](/maintain-tests/auto-fix).

  />

## 3. **The test is flaky**

Flaky tests produce different results when running the exact same test case. We are deploying multiple strategies to fight flakiness, but it can't be prevented 100% of the time just yet.
