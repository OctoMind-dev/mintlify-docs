## Have the AI agent auto-generate more tests

Similar to the initial **AI test generation** during project setup you can use the generate more feature to expand your test case suite.

Go into the test case view and hover over the `generate more` icon - a button will appear. Click on it.

Our AI agent will generate up to 3 new tests following up on the test case you launched it from. The original test will be added as a **dependency** automatically. It will auto-generate steps for every generated test case.

You can follow the progress of these newly created test cases in the stack.

For each test, the AI agent has auto-generated test steps, validated them and where the validation succeeded, it turned the test **ON** - [into active mode](/execute-test-cases).

Help the AI agent when it couldn't quite nail the auto-generation - **yellow alert** highlights a failed step generation. See how in the [edit test case](/edit-test-case) section.
