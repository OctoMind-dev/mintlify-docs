## Have the AI agent auto-generate more tests

Similar to the initial **AI test generation** during project setup you can use the `generate more from here` feature and `create a new test from here` to expand your test case suite.

Go into the test case view and click on the `plus` icon. Two options open:

  />
</Frame>

With the first - `generate more from here` - our AI Agent will discover and auto-generate up to 3 new tests "following" the test case you launched it from. The original test will be added as a **dependency** automatically.

The second option - `create new test from here` - allows you to prompt the Agent with a specific test flow instruction to create a test "following" the test you launched it from.

You can follow the progress of these newly created tests in the **AI Agent status bar**.

At the end of the agent run, the Agent should have auto-generated test steps and validated them for each test case. For those that the validation succeeded, it turned the test **ON** - [into active mode](/get-started/execute-test-cases).

Help the Agent when it couldn't quite nail the auto-generation - **yellow alert** highlights a failed step generation. See how you [help the Agent to generate a test case successfully](/guides/help-agent-succeed.mdx).

It's possible that the Agent fails to generate a test ([here are some reasons why](/guides/agent-fails)) or needs help with something - the test is highlighed in **yellow**. This is a [step by step guide on how you'll help the Agent by nudging it in the right direction](/guides/help-agent-succeed.mdx).
