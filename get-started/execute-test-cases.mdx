## Run your active test cases

You should have number of **active tests** in your test suite by now. They are `on`.

To check if there are any bugs in your new build or in production preventing your users from operating your app, you will have to **run the tests**.

### 1. Trigger a test run

To run all active tests instantly click `run all` and then `in app`. This will trigger a test run resulting in a [test report](/test-reports.mdx) visible in the Octomind app. We run the tests in parallel to make sure they run completes under 20 minutes, regardless of the number of your active test cases.

Useful for **branch deployments** - you can run your tests against any other accessible URL. Select `in app on a different URL` instead.

<Warning>
  We also **"run"** a test cases when you save changes to a test you have
  edited. We validate the test itself to see if it's not broken. This doesn't
  mean it will run automatically when you trigger a test run. You have to turn
  the test case `on`.
</Warning>

### 2. Understand test results

Every test run will produce a **test report** where you will see all test results. They will tell you if everything runs as it's supposed to or if something is broken.

Go to the [test report](/test-reports.mdx) section to learn about test reports.

### 3. Why is a test red?

Red signals the test has failed. This might have 3 reasons:

1. You have a bug in your app
   We will pinpoint you to exact moment where it broke. Swipe through the **report snapshots** or launch the **trace viewer** for more details. For an even more precise debugging, we created the open source [Debugtopus](/debugtopus.mdx) to use locally on your machine.

2. The test is broken
   End-to-end tests tend to break when anything in the app changes. This is not just annoying, but a major time investment.

   We can fix it for you. This feature in included in [Octomind's paid tiers](https://www.octomind.dev/pricing).

3. The test is flaky
   Flaky tests produce different results when running the exact same test case. We are deploying multiple strategies to fight flakiness, but it can't be prevented 100% of the time just yet.

## Schedule regular test runs

The point of software testing is to test regularly. You can [schedule tests](/scheduled-execution.mdx) by clicking the `schedule` button in the `project overview`.
This is a great strategy for synthetic monitoring of your app in production.

## Trigger test runs via curl command

If you do not use pipelines and want to manually trigger the test execution from outside our app, e.g. from your terminal, you can do it with a cURL command. [Learn how.](/execution-without-ci.mdx)

## Trigger test runs from your CI

Integrating our tests to your CI pipeline is a great way to make sure you didn't break the app with new releases. Learn [how to integrate Octomind into your CI/CD](/integrations-overview.mdx).

## Run your tests locally

Octomind tests are written in standard Playwright code. You can download it an run the test locally. This is how you use our open source [Debugtopus](/debugtopus.mdx) to do so.
