There are many ways how you can fix, update or enhance an existing a test case in Octomind.

## Edit test steps manually

Manual editing is accessible via the `steps` tab in the **test detail view**.

### Change locator

the locator indicates the element in your app you want to interact with in a particular test step. When should you change it?

Maybe the AI Agent addressed the wrong locator when generating the test. Or the flow in the app changed and you have to point the test step to a different element.

- Go to the snapshot of the relevant test step
- Hover over the **visual locator picker**
- Click `change locator`
- Select a different locator with your mouse in the snapshot

### Change interaction or assertion type

Use the **visual locator picker** to change the type of the locator. Your options are currently:

- `interactions` - enter text, type multiple character, execute javascript, navigate to, press key, select option, click, hover, upload, drag, extract, open email in new page, close page, wait for
- `assertions` - visible, hidden, disabled, have value, checked, unchecked, contains text, has style

These are all available for manual editing and in the [Recorder](/build-tests/recorder). A more [limited selection](/more-info/faq#13-what-types-of-interactions-and-assertions-can-the-agent-handle%3F) can be used by our AI Agent.

We are constantly adding new interaction and assertion types.

### Add and remove steps

Click on `add step` and drag the `new step` to its respective place in the step sequence. The **snapshot** on the right will adapt so you can use the **visual locator picker** to select the locator.

Delete steps by clicking on the `trash` icon in the upper right corner of the test step view or by pressing backspace(`âŒ«`) or the delete key(`DEL`).

### Drag & drop, duplicate and copy paste steps

Octomind test steps can be flexibly manipulated. You can **drag and drop** steps to different places in the sequence, duplicate them by clicking on the `duplicate` icon in the upper right corner or simply `select` a step and **copy & paste** it where you need it. `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` (or `Cmd-C` / `Cmd-V` for Mac) works also for copy pasting steps from other test cases.

## Record new steps

You can access the `Recorder` from within the test case detail. Click the `record from here` button to launch it. The recorder replays previous steps and you're good to record next ones.

## Edit prompt and restart AI generation

You can edit the prompt and have the AI agent `regenerate` test steps based on the new prompt. We will ask you to select **the last step** in the sequence you want to keep. The AI agent will regenerate test steps from this step onward.

Or you have simply hit the `regenerate` button to regenerate the steps based on the same prompt.

## Edit dependencies

Click on the `refresh` icon next to the existing **test dependency** and select a more suitable option to chain your test with.

## Save and run edits

`Save & run` your test case to see if it works. You can click on the `run only` button if you want to validate the test first before saving it or `save only` if you want to keep the changes without validating them.

By the way, we will warn you if you try to leave without saving the test case.

<Tip>
  Double check that your newly edited test is active - the toggle is `on`. Your
  active tests will run it in your next **test report**.
