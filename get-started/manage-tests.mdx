## Views

You have 2 options to view your test cases. In the `dependencies` view, you can see the test cases as they chain together in execution sequences:

<Frame caption="'test cases' page - dependency view, 12/2024">
  <img
    src="/images/accounts/test-cases-page.png"
    alt="test cases page view in dependency view"
  />
</Frame>

Or you can use the customizable `folders` view. If you don't like the dependency tree view and prefer your own arrangement, you can use the folder view now. Create new folders and move your test cases into them to organize your list as you wish.

  <img
    src="/images/accounts/folders-view.png"
    alt="creating a new folder in 'folders' view"
  />
</Frame>

## Folders

In the folders view, use a unique name to to create and edit folder as you wish. Use the `into folder` icon in the test case you want to move.

You can also pick folders right from the start when creating tests.

    alt="creating a new folder in 'folders' view"
    width="500px"
  />
</Frame>

## Tags

We added customizable tags to test cases so you can slice & dice your test suites and run the happy path tests more frequently or tag to exclude your flaky tests. Go to the test case, add a tag and save the test.

  />
</Frame>

## Search

Go to the `search` window to look for specific test cases in your test suite.

    alt="search for a specific test case"
