## Sign up to Octomind in under 2 minutes

### 1. Give us a URL

We'll ask for a URL of the application you want to test. The URL has to be publicly accessible. We can test both in staging and in production, as long as we can access the site.

<info>
  We can also test private apps, but we can't use it in our sign-up process. To
  create an account, give us a publicly available URL first. Once in the app,
  you'll be able create a new project for the private app via [private location
  worker](/proxy/private-location.mdx).
</info>

</Frame>

### 2. Name your project

The second page will render a screenshot of the url you provided. We check if it is accessible. You can name your project now. We'll propose one similar to the url you provided.
But you can choose your own.

<Frame caption="Second page of the setup flow: Name your project, screenshot 07/2024">
  <img
    src="/images/setup/setup-2-project.png"
    alt="name your project screen, screenshot 07/2024"
  />
</Frame>

<div class="mt-8" />

### 3. Sign up

Now we need to sign you up. Please, give us your email, so we can get in touch.

<Frame caption="Third page of the setup flow - create account, screenshot 10/2024">
  <img
    src="/images/setup/setup-3-create-account.png"
    alt="create account, screenshot 10/2024"
  />
</Frame>

You should receive a confirmation email that contains a link for you confirm your email and set your password.

### 4. Open the Octomind app for the first time

After being redirected back to [app.octomind.dev](https://app.octomind.dev/), you will land on your **project overview** page.

`Create a new test` section is highlighted - that's the place to start.

<Frame caption="Project overview page after sign-up, 07/2025">
  <img

    alt="Opening the Octomind app on project overview for the first time"
  />
</Frame>

### 5. Create your first tests

Click on the `get started` button. A selection of `recommended tests` will appear.

<Frame caption="Recommended tests section, 07/2025">
  <img
    src="/images/get-started/recommended-tests.png"
    alt="Recommended tests section when creating first tests"
  />
</Frame>

Our AI Agent has gone through your website, checked what relevant test cases you might want to create first. Select one or refresh to get new recommendations.

Click `next`.

<info>
  **cookie banner** and a **required login functionality** will be the first
  ones to be identified - their functionality is usually a prerequisites for all
  the other tests. They will be added as dependency for other tests.
</info>

If the AI Agent finds a required login, it will ask you for test credentials. It will use them to generate and run a **login test**. It will be added as dependency for other tests. So will be the **cookie banner test** if one is found.

<Frame caption="Required login test identified and recommended, 07/2025">
  <img
    src="/images/get-started/login-test-recommended.png"
    alt="Required login test identified and recommended"
  />
</Frame>

<Warning>
These credentials are only usable for username/password logins not for social logins. Login using your Google, Facebook, etc. account will not work.

</Warning>

You can create a login test later. Learn how to create a [pre-prompted login test](/build-tests/prompt-agent#pre-prompted-login-test).

### 6. Refine the prompt

We will generate test cases you selected. But first, we need you to review the prompt we prepared. You can instruct the Agent in natural language to change the prompt here, or refine the prompt manually in the next step.

<Frame caption="Refine prompt example, 07/2025">
  <img
    src="/images/get-started/refine-prompt.png"
    alt="Refine prompt example"
  />
</Frame>

Click `generate` to add details, rename the test or refine the prompt. When everything is all set, click `finalize`.

<Frame caption="Finalize test case, 07/2025">

Watch a short video where we showcase these steps on a sandbox app.

### 7. We generate the test case

We started generating your test case.

<Frame caption="Test is being generated, 07/2025">
  <img
    src="/images/get-started/generation-ongoing.png"
    alt="test case in the process of being generated"
  />
</Frame>

If you notice the Agent went off track, you can take over the generation process, record your specific few step manually and handover back to the Agent.

Watch how:

  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dIKaGITE08E?si=RGH-ZL8EcF3Ddb2T"

  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

It's possible that the Agent fails to generate a test ([here are some reasons why](/guides/agent-fails)) or needs help with something - the test is highlighted in **yellow**. This is a [step by step guide on how you'll help the Agent by nudging it in the right direction](/guides/help-agent-succeed).

After being generated successfully, in the right panel, proceed to **validation** to run it and check whether it's working properly.

<Frame caption="validate a generated test case, 07/2025">
  <img
    src="/images/get-started/validate.png"
    alt="Validate a generated test case"
    width="300"
  />
</Frame>

Create more tests using our [recommendations](/build-tests/recommended-tests), [spawn existing tests](/build-tests/recommended-tests#spawning-from-existing-test-cases) or [prompt new tests from scratch](/build-tests/prompt-agent).

### 8. Batch test generation

To speed up the process of creating a test suite, you can also use our **batch generation process**. It is a more guided auto-discovery process - the Agent automatically discovers test cases in the area you gave it via natural language.

Start creating a new test case. After selecting the starting point, chose the `batch create` tab. Instruct the Agent what kind of tests to discover.

<Frame caption="Example of a batch create instruction, 09/2025">
  <img
    src="/images/get-started/batch-create.png"
    alt="Example of a batch create instruction"
  />
</Frame>

The Agent will start exploring relevant test cases, generating them and validating. This might take a while.

</Frame>

## Run tests to check your app for bugs

Once you've built your test suite, you can [execute your active test cases](/get-started/execute-tests) to check your app for bugs. Every test execution will produce a [test report](/manage-tests/test-reports) with details of the run and debugging information in case of a failed test.

## Evaluate your test results

Inside each test report, you can find the test results for the executed test cases:

- a green test result indicates a successful test run, meaning that your site passed the test described in the test case
- a red test result indicates a test failure, meaning we could not successfully run the test case steps. These are the [possible reasons for failed test](/maintain-tests/why-tests-fail).

Click on it to see in which step is broken and [diagnose the reason for the failure](/maintain-tests/inspect-broken-tests). If it's fixable, you can [debug it](/maintain-tests/inspect-broken-tests#what-to-do-next%3F-how-to-i-fix-the-test%3F).

Find out more about [test reports](/manage-tests/test-reports).
