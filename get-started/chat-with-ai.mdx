## Chat with our in-built AI agent

### Open the chat

Our AI chat is always available in the top bar of the Octomind app.

### Ask the AI about anything Octomind related

Our AI chat agent has access to these docs and can help you get started with creating test cases, or answering questions about what Octomind can do

### Let the AI agent help you.

Our Agent cannot only answer questions for you it can also call our own [mcp-server](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/octomind-mcp), meaning it can help you achieve tasks
in Octomind.

### It can also discover new test cases for you

Our AI chat also has access to your existing test cases and can recommend new ones if you want it to
