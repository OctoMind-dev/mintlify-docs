Octomind is supporting a variety of different CI/CD providers.
We provide native integrations for GitHub and Azure DevOps. They allow us to comment back into your pipeline.
For all other providers we currently only provide an API to trigger test runs.

You can always see results in our app https://app.octomind.dev.
