Octomind is supporting a variety of different CI/CD providers. For GitHub and Azure
DevOps we are providing native integrations. They allow to comment back into your pipeline.
For all other providers we currently only provide an api to trigger test runs.

Test results can always be seen in https://app.octomind.dev.
