- Dr.Ink now does not need to navigate to a page anymore. Instead the page is injected. This is more stable and faster.
- We improved the welcome screen experience.
- We introduced a basic test case everybody will get to make sure the page is at least reachable.

## 2023-08-09

- We now correctly detect DIVs with attached event handlers as interaction elements during discovery.

- We fixed a bug where an empty list of test reports resulted in an error.

- We introduced the test database!
