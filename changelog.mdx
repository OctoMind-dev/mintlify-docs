    src="images/setup/setup-11-suggest-more.png"
    alt="have AI suggest more test cases"
  />
</Frame>

- `Open status for new test cases`: In order to mark test cases coming out of **suggest more** as new (until you've opened them for the first time), we introduced a new column **open status** to properly persist the state.

<Frame caption="Open status on new suggested tests, 08/2024">

## 2024-07-11

- `Automatic login and cookie banner tests` at sign-up. When you sign up to Octomind or create new project (add a new URL):

1. AI agent goes through your site and checks for cookie banners.
2. If a cookie banner is present, it creates a cookie banner test.
3. AI agent checks if you have a login at your site.
4. If you do, it asks you for test credentials.
5. You give it your test credentials.
6. AI agent auto-generates a login test.
7. The cookie and the login tests will be populated into all new auto-generated tests as dependencies.

- `Shadow DOM & iFrames`: It looks like we figured out how to handle them. Until you serve us the next 100 edge cases.

## 2024-06-24

- `New project overview`: Your project homepage has a new overview layout. We aimed for a less cluttered design while keeping the flexibility and all features at hand.

  2. `run` button: to run the selected test case
  3. `publish` button

  The `run` button is also visible on published test cases
