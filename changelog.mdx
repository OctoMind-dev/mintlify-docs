## 2024-02-23

- `improved stability`: made sure our app is running smoothly without hick-ups even with multiple test report running in parallel. Now our agent and test execution are serverless.
- `discover test cases`: our AI Agent will analyse your webpage and suggest multiple prompts

    alt="new discovery feature"

</Frame>

- `approval workflow`: once our AI Agent has finished the discovery, you have an option to approve or discard the provided suggestions.
  Discarding will delete the draft, while approval will start our AI Agent with the corresponding prompt

- `save` button for test case draft overhaul:

  we replaced the save rail with multiple buttons that were hidden in a separate screen. Now we have 3 separate buttons

  3. `publish` button

  The `run` button is also visible on published test cases
