## 2024-06-20

- We merged and simplified test case view. Bye bye, way too many tabs.

## 2024-06-17

- `shadow DOM and iFrames` - the AI agent can handle most shadow DOMs and iFrames now

## 2024-06-13

- We mark broken locators now. A yellow highlight and an indicator will point to the locator that doesn‚Äôt do the thing it‚Äôs supposed to.
  <Frame caption="screen recording of a broken locator being pinpointed, 06/2024">

    />
  </Frame>

## 2024-06-10

- We removed automatically generated `link tests`. We generated too many link tests on dynamic elements that broke constantly. We will come back with a better solution.

## 2024-06-05

- We add `dependencies` automatically now. We now add a cookie banner test as dependency automatically. We will be adding more common dependencies in the future.
- less obstructive `test editing` - interaction and assertion types can be switched now

## 2024-06-04

- `AI discovery`: Instead of just giving you proposals for test cases, we now generate steps and validate the proposed test cases automatically. Tests we feel confident about are published to your test suite automatically.

## 2024-05-27

- `improved AI discovery` - delivers more functional and less reachability-focused tests. The AI agent will also suggest less functionally similar tests.

## 2024-05-23

- most of `LangChain` has been removed from our stack. Learn [why we no longer use it to build our AI agents.](https://www.octomind.dev/blog/why-we-no-longer-use-langchain-for-building-our-ai-agents)
- we support nested iFrames in snapshots now
- `steps editing` - we added drag and drop for changing order
- `AI agent` can handle elements with never ending animations and invisible input forms now, like password fields, checkboxes or radio boxes

## 2024-05-15

- ‚Äç`reduced test flakiness` through improved timeout logic.

## 2024-05-08

- streaming `AI Agent indicators`: At any given moment, you'll know what the agent is doing during discovery or when it‚Äôs running in drafts. No more staring at a spinning circle ‚≠ïÔ∏è wondering when it will finish.
- improved UX for step deletion
- improved `world model` of the AI agent: its ability to understand context and derive the correct actions

## 2024-05-03

- `hotkeys` added for editing test steps help you navigate between steps using arrow keys
- `test case grouping`: We will group your test cases. We started with the ‚Äúlink tests‚Äù category and will add more soon.
- `status icons` for test cases and step results
- `AI agent` can handle SVG elements like images and icons now
- `duplicate navigation fixed`: We reduced the frequency in which agents get stuck in loops.

## 2024-04-23

- `AI agent`: We are extracting all accessibility attributes to improve its performance.

## 2024-04-18

- `AI agent`: vision added to current agent state

## 2024-04-15

- `in-app & email notifications`: we will let you know in the app once your test run has finished or our AI agent completed its discovery. We will ONLY send you an email if your test report is red üî¥
- `scheduling test reports`: We are now enabling you run your test reports on a fixed schedule (daily/ weekly/ bi-weekly). There's even email notifications now for when your scheduled run failed so you never miss a ~beat~ bug.

      alt="scheduling of test reports"
    />
  </Frame>

## 2024-04-08

- `snapshots for picking locators`: Not familiar with selectors and DOM elements? We got you covered! Test case steps now allow you to select elements in your page visually, both for interacting with them and asserting that they are there.

  <Frame caption="screen recording 04/2024">
    <img
      src="/images/changelog/snapshots.gif"
      alt="picking elements inside of page snapshots"

  </Frame>

- `reworked publish workflow`: whenever you save a draft of a test case, you get the option to publish it to include it in future test report runs

## 2024-04-02

- `expandable step editing`: the panel for editing test case steps now expands and gives you more space to make changes to your test cases

## 2024-02-23

- `improved stability`: made sure our app is running smoothly without hick-ups even with multiple test report running in parallel. Now our agent and test execution are serverless.
- `discover test cases`: our AI Agent will analyse your webpage and suggest multiple prompts

<Frame caption="screenshot 02/2024">
  <img
    src="/images/changelog/discover-screen.png"
    alt="new discovery feature"
  />
</Frame>

  Discarding will delete the draft, while approval will start our AI Agent with the corresponding prompt

  <img src="/images/changelog/auto-fix.png" alt="auto fix feature" />
</Frame>

- `save` button for test case draft overhaul:

  we replaced the save rail with multiple buttons that were hidden in a separate screen. Now we have 3 separate buttons

  1. `save` button: to save changes made
  2. `run` button: to run the selected test case
  3. `publish` button

  The `run` button is also visible on published test cases

  <Frame caption="screenshot 02/2024">

## 2024-01-26

- `Manual test creation`: We have added a low-code option to generate new tests if AI generation struggles. With increasing performance, our AI agent will do more and more of the heavy lifting. In the meantime, you can easily create a specific test case with a few clicks & adding selectors.
