## CI/CD pipeline integration

In order to integrate Octomind into your CI/CD pipeline, you will need a GitHub Action and a GitHub App.

### 1. Install the GitHub App

Start with installting the `GitHub App`. We will be commenting back on the test results via the app.

<Tip>
  Install the GitHub App from here https://github.com/apps/octomind-dev.

### 2. Allow GitHub Comments

We’ll ask you to grant access to your repository to read metadata & read and write access to pull requests so we are allowed to comment back into pull requests. It will list the test results with additional links to more details, looking like this ↓

We are very cautios about the permissions we need to protect your IP. We won’t need any other permissions.

<Info>**We won’t be able to see your code.**</Info>

### 3. Include the GitHub Action

Include the following `GitHub Action` into your CI/CD build pipeline on pull request.

```
uses: OctoMind-dev/automagically-action-execute@v2
  with:
    url:
    token: ${{ secrets.AUTOMAGICALLY_TOKEN }}
    testTargetId: <your testTargetId that you also get from us>
```

We assume you are running branch deployments so that every change can be tested in isolation. We will provide you a **token / api key** via email to trigger your test suite. It will look similar to this: sk-12345678.abcdefg123. You will inject the publicly accessible url of your branch deployment and the token / api key via GitHub Action. We provide a separate token for each project.

<Tip>
  **The GitHub action is published here:**

## Test suite setup

We will compose the test suite for you. In this way, we’ll learn about the complexities and adjust our discovery technology to cover your user flows. Playwright code will be generated on the fly for execution and in a later iteration for download. Feel free to download the code and use it to your benefit.

### What we need from you to setup the test suite

| discovery url | url                 | The url we can use to discover the initial set of test cases                                                        |
| dev account   | username & password | User account to your deployed app in your dev system which we can use for test discovery as well as executing tests |

## Test runs

Tests will be hosted by Octomind and executed by Octomind on pull request. For now, please, expect a delay before you receive your test results. Success will be reported immediately. Failures will be reviewed manually to learn failure reasons and to make sure we avoid false positives to the greatest extent possible.
