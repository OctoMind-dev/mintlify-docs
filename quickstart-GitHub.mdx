## CI/CD pipeline integration

In order to integrate Octomind into your CI/CD pipeline, you will need a GitHub Action and a GitHub App.

### 1. Create an APIKey

<Snippet file="snippet-apiKey.mdx" />

### 2. Copy your testTargetId

<Snippet file="snippet-testTarget.mdx" />

### 3. Allow GitHub Comments

Install the `GitHub App`. We will be commenting back the test results via the app.

<Tip>
  Install the GitHub App from here https://github.com/apps/octomind-dev.

  />

### 4. Allow GitHub Comments

We’ll ask you to grant access to your repository to read metadata & read and write access to pull requests so we are allowed to comment back into pull requests. It will list the test results with additional links to more details, looking like this ↓

    alt="Example of Octomind test results in a pull request comment"
  />
</Frame>

We are very cautios about the permissions we need to protect your IP. We won’t need any other permissions.

<Info>**We won’t be able to see your code.**</Info>

### 5. Include the GitHub Action

Include the following `GitHub Action` into your CI/CD build pipeline on pull request.

```yaml
- uses: OctoMind-dev/automagically-action-execute@v2
  with:
    url: <publicly accessible url to your deployment>
    token: ${{ secrets.AUTOMAGICALLY_TOKEN }}
    testTargetId: <your testTargetId that you also get from us>
```

We assume you are running branch deployments so that every change can be tested in isolation. Please inject the publicly accessible url of your branch deployment, testTargetId and apiKey.

<div className="mt-8" />

  **The GitHub action is published here:**
