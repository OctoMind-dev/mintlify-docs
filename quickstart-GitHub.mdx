## CI/CD pipeline integration

In order to integrate Octomind into your CI/CD pipeline, you will need a GitHub Action and a GitHub App.

</Frame>

<Snippet file="snippet-apiKey.mdx" />

<Snippet file="snippet-testTarget.mdx" />

### 3. Allow GitHub Comments

Install the `GitHub App`. We will be commenting back the test results via the app.

<Tip>

  />
</Frame>

### 4. Allow GitHub Comments

We’ll ask you to grant access to your repository to read metadata & read and write access to pull requests so we are allowed to comment back into pull requests. It will list the test results with additional links to more details, looking like this ↓

  />
</Frame>

### 5. Include the GitHub Action

Include the following `GitHub Action` into your CI/CD build pipeline on pull request https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-action-execute
We assume you are running branch deployments so that every change can be tested in isolation.You will inject the publicly accessible url of your branch deployment, testTargetId and apiKey.

<div className="mt-8" />

<Tip>
  **We won’t need any other permissions. We won’t be able to see your code.**
