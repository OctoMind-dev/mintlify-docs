## Tl;dr:

You can use the recorder to record steps for your test case. You can either start from scratch or
start from a prompt / existing steps unsing the "record from here" button.

## How is the Octomind recorder different from Playwright Codegen?

The recorder is a feature that allows you to record steps for your test case. It is different from Playwright Codegen in that it is a tool
that allows you to control what step to record. It works based on snapshots that represent the current state of the page.

So for example when you choose an element to interact with, the recorder will only record the interaction and change the browsers state when
you click the `record the next step` button. This allows correcting either the element or the interaction type. You can also
record **assertions** to validate the state of the page.

</Frame>

You can first define the element to interact with. Then you can choose the interaction type. This way you have fine control over what
interaction to record. This is especially useful when you want to record for instance hovering or drag'n'drop.

The interaction will only executed when you click the `record the next step` button. The browser will then move forward and the
recordder presents the next snapshot after the interaction was executed.
