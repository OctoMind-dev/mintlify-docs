You know what [most common reasons why Octomind's tests fail](/guides/test-debugging-1) are. You've learnt how to fix them if the [prompt is causing the AI agent getting stuck](/guides/prompt-debugging). You know how to [debug test steps using the visual editor](/guides/test-debugging-3).

This is where we'll show you how to diagnose and debug **active test case failures** - red tests produced by a test run summarized in a `test report`.

To refresh - 'red' failed test is extremely important signal in testing. They are caused by 3 reasons:

1. **You have a bug in your app:** This is why these test exist. They catch bugs before your users do.

2. **The test is broken:** End-to-end tests tend to break when the app changes. This is not just annoying, but a major time investment to main them.

3. **The test is flaky:** Flaky tests produce different results when running the exact same test case. They can't be prevented 100% of the time just yet.

## Diagnosing methods

Octomind provides two methods for diagnosing and debugging active test failures:

- Test timeline
- Playwright Trace Viewer

### Test timeline

The `test timeline` provides a screenshot of every step executed during a test run, with the selector marker indicating the locator successfully found the targeted element.

</Frame>

<div class="mt-8" />

  />
</Frame>

But the below step failed because the **expected button text “Sign up today” wasn't found, indicated by the absence of the selector marker**.

Here once more in a sequence:

  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

The timeline view is sufficient for identifying most test failures.

### Playwright Trace Viewer

But if you need to go deeper, click the `debug` tab to access the Playwright code executed during the test and access to the `Playwright Trace Viewer` for an advanced visual debugging UI.

    alt="Link to Playwright trace viewer in the debug tab of the test report detail"
    width={300}
  />
</Frame>

**Playwright's Trace Viewer** is a GUI tool for debugging end-to-end tests, with a granular timeline complete and detailed diagnostic information such as actions (clicks, navigation), events, console messages, network requests, and more that were generated during a test run.

  />
</Frame>

Developers will be familiar with the tabbed interface at the bottom of the screen which functions similarly to in-browser developer tools.

## Correct the broken test steps

If the cause of the failure is a broken test, this is how you adjust it by [editing a test cases](/get-started/edit-test-case).

## The Hack: How we fix our own tests

Since we dogfood our own end-to-end tests, this is how we usually proceed:

1. go to the test case
2. check the **prompt** - if it's not matching the desired flow anymore, adjust it
3. click `regenerate steps`
4. select the last step you wish to keep
5. confirm `generate steps`

The Agent will regenerate steps of your test and validate them. If it's alright, click `save & run` or adjust steps if needed.

<Tip>
  Runs and respective snapshots and traces become outdated after a while. Start
  another run to see an up-to-date state to tell which step broke. Refresh it by
  hitting the `run only` button under `save & run`.

## Work in progress: Test auto-maintainance

Our goal at Octomind is to make **end-to-end testing** simple and intuitive while also providing access to low-level code and diagnostic tools such as the locator code editor and utilizing Playwright's Trace Viewer.

We are aware that **maintenance of automated end-to-end tests** - the fixing of broken tests - is one of the biggest productivity killers in testing. We are working on a auto-maintenance feature right now that will make QA by orders of magnitude more efficient.

We'll keep you posted.

In the meantime, please [reach out to our team on Discord](https://discord.gg/3ShnZMKRfA) if you have feedback on how we can improve the debugging experience, or if you need help debugging a tricky test.
