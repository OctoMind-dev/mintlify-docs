## A digit typing problem

In some test scenarios, such as verifying One-Time Passwords (OTPs), you may need to enter a number (e.g. a 6-digit code) into six separate input fields. This pattern is common across login flows, 2FA prompts, and similar UI components.

> “Sometimes, I need to type a number - say, 6 digits - into 6 different fields. How do I automate this reliably?”

While this may seem straightforward, there are some nuances that can make automation tricky. Fortunately, there are a few strategies you can use depending on how the form is implemented.

## Strategies for typing OTPs into separate fields

### 1. Hidden input field (overlay)

Many implementations use a **single hidden input field** overlaid on the six visible boxes. When you paste the full code into this hidden field, it automatically distributes the digits into the appropriate boxes.

**How to handle this:**

- Locate the hidden input (using inspect or test recording).
- Paste the entire OTP code into this field using a standard Enter text step.
- The page logic should split and fill each digit correctly.

This is usually the most reliable approach if supported by the application.

### 2. Typing into the first box (with character simulation)

In other cases, the form expects input to start from the **first visible digit box**, and then distributes each subsequent digit automatically.

However, this behavior **often doesn't work with a regular `enter text step`**, because it mimics pasting rather than typing. Instead, you should use `type multiple characters` - this simulates real typing, one character at a time.

<Warning>
  If the default typing speed is too fast (default: 10ms between characters),
  some digits may be dropped or skipped. This can cause the input to be
  incomplete or incorrect.
</Warning>

#### Solution

- Use the setting `character delay in ms` to slow down typing speed.
- Try increasing the delay to `100ms` or even `200ms` to ensure stability.
- Adjust based on how sensitive the input fields are to rapid keystrokes.

## Tl;dr:

When automating OTP or multi-field number inputs, it's important to understand how the input is processed by the UI. Use one of the following strategies depending on your case:

- A hidden field? → Paste the full code directly.
- Visible fields with auto-forwarding? → Use Type multiple characters with an increased character delay.

Both methods can be fine-tuned for speed and reliability using the available test settings.
