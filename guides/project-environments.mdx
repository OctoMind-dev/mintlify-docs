Based on our usage data, the difference between `Environments` and `Projects` is sometimes not well understood. We will clarify the difference between the concepts and provide guidance on when and how to use each effectively.

## Projects

When you sign up for Octomind, you automatically create your first project during the onboarding process. A project serves as a foundational unit with the following attributes:

- **Name:** You can change the project name at any time.
- **URL:** This is fixed and cannot be changed after creation. The URL acts as the reference point for all agent interactions, such as test discovery, test proposals, and auto-maintenance. Think of it as the core reference system for our AI agent.

When you create a project, a default environment is automatically set up for you:

    alt="New Octomind project created"
    width={400}
  />
</Frame>

<div class="mt-8" />

    alt="Default enviroment for a newproject created"
    width={400}
  />
</Frame>

Additionally, test runs accept a URL as a target for executing tests. This feature is particularly useful if you want to test against a specific branch.

<note>
  In our example, where only one environment is configured, the target URL must
  match the same test user credentials and security settings as the default
  environment.

    alt="Running tests against a selected UR"
    width={400}
  />
</Frame>

## Environments

Environments exist within projects and represent different configurations for the same app under test. Each environment is defined by:

- **Name** and **URL**
- **Login parameters** (e.g., test user credentials)
- **OTP secrets** (if applicable)
- **Basic-auth settings** (if applicable)

You can create as many environments as needed, tailoring each to specific deployment configurations.

## Example: Sandbox and Staging environments

Imagine your app is deployed in two distinct environments: `Sandbox` and `Staging`. Each environment has unique characteristics:

1. **Sandbox:**

- Behind basic-auth
- Uses `testuser-sandbox@yourcompany.com`

2. **Default environment (Staging):**

- No basic-auth
- Uses `testuser-staging@yourcompany.com`
- Considered to be more stable and primarily used for QA before production deployment

Here's how you'd configure Octomind for this setup:

### 1. Project setup

- Create a project using the `Staging` environment as the reference system.
- During setup, provide the `Staging URL` and `testuser-staging` credentials.
- Compose test cases based on the `Staging` environment.

### 2. Adding Sandbox environment

- Set up a new environment for `Sandbox`, specifying its unique URL, user credentials, and authentication settings.

<Frame caption="Setting up a new enviroment for the Sandbox example, 12/2024">
  <img
    src="/images/guides/sandbox-environment.png"
    alt="Set up of a new sandbox environment"
    width={400}
  />
</Frame>

Once configured, you can run all tests against the `Sandbox` environment by selecting it from the `environment drop-down menu` or by providing the **“environment name” parameter** in your pipeline. Please, see our [GitHub documentation](https://octomind.dev/docs/integrations/quickstart-GitHub#5-include-the-github-action) for the CI pipeline details.

## When to use multiple projects

There are cases where multiple projects are more suitable than multiple environments within a single project. Here are two common scenarios:

### A: Testing multiple apps

Each app you test should have its own dedicated project. This keeps configurations and test cases separate, ensuring clarity and manageability.

### B: Testing complex apps with distinct user roles

For apps with users of significantly different roles and permissions, splitting tests across multiple projects can simplify testing. Let's look at two examples:

#### Example 1: Online meeting app

Your app includes two key roles:

- **Meeting Host:** The paying customer who organizes meetings.
- **Attendee:** A participant who typically doesn't have an account.

Since the test cases for these roles are vastly different, it's best to create a separate project for each role.

#### Example 2: Document signing app

In this app, there are two main roles:

- **User:** The paying customer who uploads documents, prepares them for signing, and shares them with participants.
- **Participant:** A non-account user who can only sign documents with limited functionality.

Here, too, splitting roles into different projects allows for cleaner, more focused test case management.
