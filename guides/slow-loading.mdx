## The problem with slow loading elements

In many testing setups, **development environments (DEV)** tend to be slower than **production (PROD) environments**. This can lead to longer page load times and failed test steps if timeouts are too short.

For example:

> “Is there any way we can increase the timeout from 30s? I have a page that takes a while to load because it's on the test system.”

This is a common challenge, and while the **global timeout is intentionally capped at 30 seconds**, there are effective strategies to handle slow-loading pages without slowing down your tests across the board.

## Why we limit the global timeout

The global timeout applies to all failures, across all test steps. Raising it can cause several problems:

- **Slower feedback loops**: If a step fails while composing or debugging a test, you'd need to wait the full timeout duration to see the error.
- **Longer execution times**: If a failing test is part of a suite and gets rerun, the delay is doubled for every affected step.
- In our experience, longer timeouts significantly **reduce the usability and efficiency** of the testing workflow.

## Recommended strategies for handling loading delays

To deal with longer load times - especially in slower environments like DEV - we recommend the following solutions:

1. **Use optional assertions**

Assertions can be used to wait for conditions like the disappearance of a loading spinner or the appearance of key elements. To make this more flexible:

- Add an `assertion` to wait for a specific element (e.g. spinner) to disappear.
- Mark it as `optional`, so that if the assertion fails, the test still continues.
- Each optional assertion adds **up to 30 seconds** of additional wait time.

<Tip>
  In fast environments like PROD, these assertions pass instantly and don't
  delay the test run.
</Tip>

2. **Use the wait step**

You can also use the `wait step`, which supports several waiting strategies:

- Wait for elements to appear, disappear, or become clickable.
- Use dynamic waits based on element states.
- A **fixed wait time** is also available (though not recommended), as it can either be too short or unnecessarily long.

<Info>
  Each wait step provides an **additional 30 seconds** of potential wait time.

## Tl;dr

Although the global timeout is limited to 30 seconds for performance reasons, you can manage slow-loading pages by using `optional assertions` or `wait steps`.
These techniques allow for flexible waiting, adapt to varying load speeds between environments, and help you avoid unnecessary delays in faster systems.
